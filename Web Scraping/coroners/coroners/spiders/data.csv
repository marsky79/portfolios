"<td class=""govuk-table__cell""><strong>CORONER’S CONCERNS</strong><br>During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.<br> <br>The <strong>MATTERS OF CONCERN </strong>are as follows.<br> <br>On 28 March 2023, Igor refused to get out of the shower [REDACTED]. Hostel staff took various actions, including calling the crisis team. The crisis team decided that Igor did not need daily visits, but told staff to call back if there was any change or further concern.<br> <br>1.      On 14 April 2023, staff found Igor outside, drowsy and incoherent, cold and wet, but did not re-contact the crisis team.<br> <br>2.      Igor was a vulnerable young man, recently homeless, but the last time that any member of staff had a meaningful conversation with him was on 20 April 2023, ten days before he died.<br> <br>3.      The Depaul executive director of services recognised at inquest that there should have been more staff conversation with Igor throughout his time at the London Youth Hub.<br> <br>4.      She also acknowledged that greater attempts should have been made by staff to engage with partner agencies regarding Igor’s care and welfare.<br> <br>5.      Igor was only 18 years old and his father did visit him, but the hostel did not have any contact details for his family.<br> <br>I heard evidence at inquest that Depaul conducted an internal investigation into Igor’s death. The fact of the report was not disclosed to my office in advance of the inquest as it should have been, and I did not see it until it was mentioned in evidence at the inquest.<br> <br>However, I have read the report since. It went into some detail and identified that, when Igor was found at 6.25pm, no staff member had undertaken a welfare check of him since half past midnight, whereas there should have been at least one per shift. I was told at inquest that staff were disciplined about this after Igor’s death.<br> <br>At the time of Igor’s death, there was no national policy on when to increase welfare checks. I was told that there is now national guidance.<br> <br>The Depaul investigation also identified that staff at the London Youth Hub had not attended self harm and suicide awareness training. I heard that training has now increased and is mandatory.<br> <br>The report described the culture at the London Youth Hub as chaotic.</td>",Coroner name: Mary Hassell,Ref: 2023-0445,This report is being sent to: Depaul UK
"<td class=""govuk-table__cell""><strong>CORONER’S CONCERNS</strong><br>During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.<br><br>The <strong>MATTERS OF CONCERN</strong> are as follows:<br>1. The notes made by the SPoE Nurse for use during discussion at the screening MDT meeting did not include any reference to the report of a recent suicide attempt and the Court was not satisfied that the risk of suicide had been identified or recognised by the SPoE Nurse<br> <br>2. The Court heard that the practice at the screening MDT meeting was for the SPoE Nurse to read out the contents of the referral to the Psychiatrist who would then advise on next steps. There was no evidence to show that any form of meaningful multi-team discussion took place at the screening MDT meeting<br> <br>3. There was no direct contact between the mental health team and the Deceased (either by telephone or in person) before the decision to reject the referral was made<br> <br>4. The Consultant Psychiatrist present at the MDT meeting has no recollection of discussing the referral and whilst the evidence was that a letter to the GP practice explaining the reason for rejecting the referral was generated there is no record of this letter on the Trust’s electronic systems or having been received by the GP practice<br><br>5. The evidence was that there is no member of staff allocated to deal with referrals when the SPoE Nurse is absent from work which means that during their absence, urgent referrals are not being reviewed.<br> <br>6. There is currently no Standard Operating Procedure on how referrals into the SPoE Older Adults should be managed<br> <br>7. There is currently no system by which the management of referrals into the SPoE and related decision-making are audited.

"<td class=""govuk-table__cell""><strong>CORONER’S CONCERNS</strong><br>During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.<br> <br>The <strong>MATTERS OF CONCERN </strong>are as follows:<br>(brief summary of matters of concern)<br> <br>ACCT documents<br>In evidence at the inquest ACCT assessors and case managers accepted that they had not complied with various mandatory actions required under PSI 64/2011: Managing Prisoner Safety in Custody. They were not able to identify in evidence the risk factors it was mandatory to consider for persons at risk of suicide or self-harm. They had not recorded triggers in the relevant section of the ACCT nor recorded all risk factors in the Caremap section. One ACCT case manager stated that they did not know whether it was necessary to record a trigger if action had been taken to mitigate it. They also stated they categorised risk based on ‘remaining’ risk after action had been taken despite having not recorded the trigger.<br> <br>This leads me to have 2 concerns:<br>The first regards the provision and quality of ACCT training and refresher training given this evidence was given some 2 years after the death of Mr Huntley and well after the disruptions brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic.<br> <br>I also heard evidence that despite an ACCT being a ‘whole prison’ document (which can and should be opened by any member of staff) training was not mandatory for non-security staff.<br>In 2019 there was no joint training for prison and heathcare staff on the use of ACCT documents. I am informed by CNWL that under ACCT v6 (which has been in force since July 2021) joint training is provided for and this is reassuring. However I understand that the frequency of this training is determined in relation to operational capacity at individual establishment level. This is of concern given the evidence from witnesses at this inquest some 20 months after this version came into force.<br> <br>The second relates to the quality and effectiveness of ACCT audits. We heard evidence that ACCT documents are reviewed annually. The case manager mentioned above advised that he had not received any adverse feedback about the quality of his ACCT documents and no issues with them had been identified. Given the inadequate nature of the ACCT document opened on Mr Huntley and apparent lack of understanding about completing the documents the quality of the audits is brought into question.<br> <br>Information sharing.<br>In evidence it was clear that the ACCT document was the only written document used for sharing information between the healthcare staff employed by the NHS trust and the prison security staff. Healthcare staff record and share their information within SystemOne which the prison security staff do not have access to. Prison security staff record information within NOMIS which healthcare staff do not have access to.<br> <br>Evidence from witnesses revealed that these information systems are not necessarily fully reviewed for relevant information prior to attending ACCT meetings.<br> <br>In addition a decision relating to Mr Huntley’s care (i.e. the move to a different cell) was taken by healthcare staff at their own meeting when they did not have the benefit of information available to prison staff.<br> <br>[REDACTED] of HMP Winchester informed me that a Safety Intervention Meeting was now carried out weekly, chaired by a Senior Governor and attended by representatives of the prison, physical and mental health care providers and the probation service. This meeting covers each person subject to an ACCT and any relevant information is share via the ACCT case manager, NOMIS and the multi disciplinary team. [REDACTED] could not assist me with whether this was a HMP Winchester initiative or had a wide application across the prison estate.<br> <br>My concern is therefore that the current procedures and policies for sharing information are incomplete or not fully complied with. This renders the information on which separate teams make decisions about a prisoner incomplete and increases the risk that important factors are not considered.<br> <br>Cells<br>At HMP Winchester within the area, considered and referred to by most healthcare and prison staff, as the ‘mental health’ cells there are 2 cells which are not equipped in a way to reduce the amount of available ligature points.<br> <br>It was clear from the evidence of the healthcare staff at the MDT meeting on the 28/05/2020 that they did not consider the contents of the cell when deciding to move Mr Huntley to the ‘mental health cells’ simply due to the fact he was on an ACCT. I heard evidence that the policy of CNWL has now changed and that a cell move risk assessment must now be carried out and that there is now a revised ligature audit process. HMP Winchester informed me that there is now an annual ligature audit carried out in conjunction with the new healthcare provider at that establishment. In addition I was informed that all telephone points in the ‘mental health cells’ at HMP Winchester have now been removed and placed outside the cells. These are welcome developments.<br> <br>However at inquest those representing the HMPPS could not inform me whether all telephone points within cells designed for use by those at risk of self harm across the prison estate had been removed. Nor was any evidence available as to what consideration had been given to reducing the risk of the telephone points by design of the points themselves or the manner of their installation. Those representing were invited to provide this information after the hearing but have not done so.<br> <br>I am concerned that telephone points which provide a ligature point may remain within cells which prison and health care staff consider to be suitable for use by those at risk of self harm.<br> <br>The final area of concern is the lack of certified Safer Cells at HMP Winchester. The inquest heard evidence that these had either never existed at HMP Winchester or had not done so for many years. The evidence from prison governors was that, generally speaking within the prison estate, they were not used or proved too hard to maintain to the certified standard. However certified Safer Cells are still referred to in PSI 64/2011 as a means of managing risk from ligatures. It was heard in evidence that HMP Winchester experience high levels of self-harm and suicide and yet it did not appear that consideration had been given recently to introducing these. Those representing the HMPSS at the were invited to provide information about the status and use of safer certified cells across the prison estate. No such information has been forthcoming.</td>",Coroner name: Robert Simpson,Ref: 2023-0461,This report is being sent to: HM Prison and Probation Service

In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.<br><strong> </strong><br>The <strong>MATTERS OF CONCERN </strong>are as follows.<br>I heard evidence that there was no routine mechanism to cross reference what people are prescribed and what medication they are actually collecting, and no automatic notification to GPs who are responsible for the medication prescribing. Zee informed BEH that he had not taken his olanzapine and fluoxetine for two weeks.

"<td class=""govuk-table__cell""><strong><u>CORONER’S CONCERNS</u></strong> <strong> </strong> <br>During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.<br><strong> </strong><br>The <strong>MATTERS OF CONCERN </strong>are as follows:<br>1. Despite the deceased passing away just shy of 2 years ago, there have been inadequate improvements to manage patients with food intolerances and allergies. The Health Board has been working with other organisations in Wales to create an e-learning module and implement the use of red wrist bands for food intolerances / allergies, but this has taken far too long. The e-learning training module was uploaded to BCUHB system the day prior to the Inquest. It is strongly suspected that this was due to the impending Inquest.<br><strong> </strong><br>2. The Health Board has not investigated the incident at all. A Medical Examiner Report was prepared following the death in November 2021 highlighting the ingestion of gluten in a coeliac patient. I have raised and continue to raise a number of concerns around the inadequacy of governance and poor investigation processes.<br><strong> </strong><br>3. There were other incidences of gluten ingestion at Ysbyty Maelor and Deeside Community Hospital. On the at least 4 occasions at Deeside Community Hospital there were no Datix reports completed at the time. I was provided with no evidence that additional training, refresher training or induction training deals with when such reports should be made. I cannot be satisfied and reassured that all staff are aware of when to make a Datix report and how to complete this.</td>",Coroner name: Kate Robertson,Ref: 2023-0471,This report is being sent to: Betsi Cadwaladr University Local Health Board

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.<br> <br>The <strong>MATTERS OF CONCERN </strong>are as follows:<br>1. During the Inquest evidence was heard that: <br> <br>i. During the period from the 25th of October 2022 to the 4th of January 2023 there were no visits from a Care Coordinator, or a Community Psychiatric Nurse, and all the 2-week planned visits did not take place, so that 4 or 5 visits were missed.<br> <br>ii. There was no appointment of an interim Care Coordinator or a Community Psychiatric Nurse to cover the 2 weekly planned appointments following the absence of YL.<br> <br>iii. There was no responsibility on a Duty officer to review planned appointments during the absence of a Care Coordinator and to arrange for a Community Psychiatric Nurse to attend any planned appointments.<br> <br>iv. There were no resilience plans in place to cover the absence of a Care Coordinator, either in relation to short term or long- term absences.<br> <br>2. I request that the Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust reviews their procedures and policies to cover the absence of a Care Coordinator, both in relation to short term and long-term absences, and in relation to the appointment of an interim Care Coordinator.<br> <br>3.

"<td class=""govuk-table__cell""><strong><u>CORONER’S CONCERNS</u></strong>   <br>During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.     <br><br>The <strong>MATTERS OF CONCERN </strong>are as follows. <br>1. Despite recognising Mr Malone needed to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital in June 2023 but there was no bed capacity, BSMHFT’ RCA report identified no remedial action.<br><br>2. The Patient Safety Manager [REDACTED] gave evidence that the lack of psychiatric bed capacity remains an ongoing problem and has not been resolved, and there is a genuine risk of the same problem with another patient in the future.<br>                      <br>3. [REDACTED] added there was an exceptional process, which required a considered decision at a high level, to make a bed available through identifying someone currently occupying a bed space to be discharged. In my view, this process is unsatisfactory as it creates a different set of risks around the patient being discharged, and amplifies the chronic shortage of beds.<br><br>4. There was reference to two preceding Regulation 28 Reports to Prevent Future Deaths (both available publicly on the judiciary website) that focussed on the chronic lack of mental health resources in Birmingham and Solihull. In relation to the specific issue of a lack of psychiatric bed capacity, in the case of Peter Fleming (no bed was available in August 2022) BSMHFT’s response (September 2023) referred to their response in the earlier case of Leroy Hamilton (no bed was available in December 2021). This response (April 2023) stated more resources had been obtained and a collaborative plan had been implemented with NHS Birmingham and Solihull Integrated Care Board.<br> <br>The issue of adequately funding psychiatric beds is a local and national issue. Locally, BSMHFT require their commissioners to provide the necessary funding.<br> <br>My principal concern is that the above dates indicate available psychiatric bed capacity in Birmingham and Solihull remains inadequate. Whilst some action may have been taken it is insufficient to resolve the problem. It follows there is a genuine risk of future deaths directly connected to a shortage of psychiatric bed spaces in Birmingham and Solihull unless further action is taken.</td>",Coroner name: James Bennett,Ref: 2023-0469,This report is being sent to: Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Foundation Trust | NHS Birmingham and Solihull Integrated Care Board |Department of Health and Social Care

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.<br> <br>The <strong>MATTERS OF CONCERN </strong>are as follows:<br>(brief summary of matters of concern)<br> <br>Initial referral – there seems to be a gap at the initial referral and admission stage in obtaining information about and recording previous methods of self-harm and suicide. There also appears to be a gap in the seeking and recording of relevant information from an individual’s family at the point of referral and admission. An individual’s family is often able to provide detailed and useful information about events that may not have been previously reported and/or be able to bridge the gap in communications between various health agencies involved in someone’s care.<br> <br>Access to notes – the other concerning issue is the difficulty prevalent within the private sector in the accessing of NHS notes. It appears to be the position across the private sector that access to an individual’s notes is not provided as standard. This means that there may be a significant gap in the information available when someone is admitted to a premises run by a private healthcare provider, even within an NHS allocated bed. This gap in information can have an impact on an individual’s risk assessment and their subsequent care plan.</td>",Coroner name: Laura Bradford,Ref: 2023-0441,This report is being sent to: Langford Centre | NHS England

"<td class=""govuk-table__cell""> <strong><u>CORONER’S CONCERNS</u></strong><br>During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.<br><em> </em><br>The <strong>MATTERS OF CONCERN </strong>are as follows. <br>(1) During evidence the matter of monitoring people who attend the bridge in mental health distress was raised. There is a minimum of 2 staff in the control room and 3 staff covering “traffic duties” on the ground. The security staff at the bridge deal with a variety of security issues however this report only seeks to address their role in relation to those suffering from mental health distress. The staff are expected to identify and monitor any person of concern entering the walkways of the bridge.<br><br>This involves looking at their actions, mannerisms, behaviour and body language. Staff are expected to identify those who may require assistance and contact staffing colleagues to approach them.<br><br>It appeared there was no structured training policy in place to ensure that staff are given appropriate training to deal with identifying vulnerable people. On joining, staff have an 8 weeks mentoring course, whereby an experienced colleague shows them the role and advises on what to look for. Staff may also undertake an on line suicide prevention course and mental health first aid at work as well as safety harness/working at height training. However there appeared to be no structure to any of the training for this vital role and of more concern there was no input from a trained medical professional with significant knowledge of working with those suffering from mental health crisis. Nor was there any current input with regard to how to talk and negotiate with people in crisis. I was informed that there were many very competent staff who had good intuition, but I have concerns that without appropriate and structured input from a health care professional, any experience on the job is based on unstable foundations. It was evident that the role is vitally important in identifying those at risk and seeking the appropriate help. Without receiving knowledge from someone trained in mental health, having a substantive input on negotiation and how to interact with those in crisis then the difficult job of assessing people and reacting appropriately with them becomes very difficult.<br><br>(2) While the “Right Care/Right Person” process appears to ensure that the correct emergency service should respond if called, delays in response means often staff are left dealing with a vulnerable person for many hours due to unavailability of emergency services or mental health support.<br><br>(3) I am aware that there is a [REDACTED] Suicide Prevention Meeting where a multi-agency approach can be taken to address the reduction of suicide [REDACTED].  I consider that this may be the correct forum to recognise the unique role the staff play and implement a structured training plan with all agencies input for any person beginning work in that role.<br><br>(4)  I was informed in evidence that a vulnerable person is escorted off the bridge everyday – this shows the extent of the problem and the staff to be provided with the very best training available. I echo the views of Lizzie’s family when talking about the role that the Security Staff have “there is so much responsibility on someone’s head, for them to decide whether someone is likely to jump or not”. I feel that these people should be given a specific set training plan to help them do what is a vital and important role.</td>",Coroner name: Lorraine Harris,Ref: 2023-0439,This report is being sent to: Human Resources

As an illustration the inquest was told that pre-Covid, the average wait for a routine gynaecology referral was 18 weeks. Now in England the wait was often in excess of 12 months.

"<td class=""govuk-table__cell""><strong><u>CORONER’S CONCERNS</u></strong><br>During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.<br><strong> </strong><br>The <strong>MATTERS OF CONCERN </strong>are as follows.<br><strong> </strong><br>(1)  The serious incident investigation by the Trust has been substantially delayed. Sarah died on the 10th of July 2022 and the Trust confirmed to the Coroner’s service that there was to be a serious incident investigation on the 26th July 2022. The serious incident investigation remained unallocated and with no timeframe for completion for over 7 months and on the 13th of March 2023 as this remained the position I listed this case for Inquest on the 24th of April 2023. On the 17th April 2023 I was alerted by deceased’s family to possible progress in respect of the serious incident investigation in this case, subsequent to their formal complaint to the Trust. After making enquiries of the Trust I was informed that the report would be available at the end of May 2023 and I therefore acceded to a family request to adjourn the final hearing given the short delay this would cause. On the 25th of April 2023 the Coronial service was informed that in fact that it was unlikely that the report would be finalised by May and would be’ likely end of July/August time’. On the 26th of June I was informed that the report would now not be available until the ‘end of September/beginning of October’ and that the initial dates given were “too ambitious”. The case was listed to commence on the 16th of November 2023 on that basis. On the 28th of July the deceased’s family notified me of a likely further delay in the report being available due to the author’s sick leave from work. The Trust offered reassurance that the report remained due ‘end of September/beginning of October’. On the 28th of September a Pre Inquest Review Hearing was held in relation to a separate discrete issue and I was informed that the report was to be further delayed and would not be available until the end of October.<br><strong> </strong><br>(2)  The NHS framework sets out clearly a timescale of 60 working days for the completion of investigation reports and highlights the importance of working in an open, honest and transparent way. One of the key underpinning principles in the management of all serious incidents is that they should be timely and responsive. The purpose of the investigation is to ensure that weaknesses in a system or process are identified to understand what went wrong, how it went wrong and what can be done to prevent similar incidents occurring again.<br><strong> </strong><br>(3)  If the final version report is received by the end of October it will be some 15 months since Sarah’s death and some 13 months outside the NHS framework. This is neither timely nor responsive.<br><strong> </strong><br>(4)  I have previously issued a PFD report in relation to this issue as has the Senior Coroner for Durham and Darlington, Mr Chipperfield, who stated that Tees Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust routinely fails, to employ, in a timely way, nationally recognised process and procedure designed to prevent avoidable death. In permitting delay of “serious incident” investigations, TEWV may: (i) permit lethal hazard to persist for longer than necessary; and (ii) compromise the quality of such investigations and hence their value in preventing avoidable deaths.<br><strong> </strong><br>(5)  I am concerned that these dangers persist, despite the Trust’s response to previous PFD reports and their assurances that remedial action was being taken to eradicate the delays, and as a result it is my statutory duty to make this further report.</td>",Coroner name: Janine Richards,Ref: 2023-0383,"This report is being sent to: Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys NHS | Care Quality Commission"

"<td class=""govuk-table__cell""><strong>CORONER’S CONCERNS</strong><br>During the Inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. A number of these have been addressed and do not require a PFD report.<br><strong> </strong><br>I have also considered a report by HM Chief Inspector of Prisons, “The experience of immigration detainees in prisons,” dated September 2022. Some of the key concerns in that report mirror concerns I came to independently having heard the evidence in this Inquest. Published responses to the report suggest some concerns are being addressed, albeit it is not clear if they have been resolved.<br><strong> </strong><br>In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.<br><strong> </strong><br>The <strong>MATTERS OF CONCERN</strong> are as follows:<br>1.      Although the specific issues below were not left to the jury as “causative matters” in this Inquest, I am concerned about the potential impact of these issues in other cases.<br><strong><u>Timing of IS91 notification.</u></strong><br><strong> </strong><br>2.      The timing of the notification to Mr Santos by the SSHD that he was not to be released at the end of his custodial sentence but was to be held on immigration detention pending a decision on deportation. The SSHD target for notification is 30 days prior to release. In this case it was 8 days late. I heard PFD evidence that this 30-day target is not met in 40% of cases and that 83% of cases are notified within 7 days of the end of the sentence. I am concerned at the potential uncertainty and distress caused to Foreign National Offenders (“FNOs”) by notification at this stage.<br><strong><u>Signposting legal advice about immigration matters</u></strong><br><strong> </strong><br>3.      Mr Santos signed a form on 24 October 2020 to receive support from a charity supporting immigration detainees. Bail forms were sent to them by the prison on 29 October 2020.<br>4.      I am concerned as to how access to legal advice is facilitated and signposted.<br>5.      In PFD evidence, I was informed that FNOs (in a similar position to Mr Santos) are now entitled to 30 minutes of free legal advice following a High Court decision in February 2021. In HMP Belmarsh, this entitlement is displayed on a notice in each Houseblock. I am concerned that displaying a notice is insufficient to draw this entitlement to the attention of FNOs. I do not know if this is a wider issue in other prisons. Understanding of immigration status, including appeal and bail procedures and is complex. Access to legal advice is vital to prevent confusion.<br><strong><u>Communication between agencies</u></strong><br><strong> </strong><br>6.      Communication issues between the agencies dealing with immigration and sentence planning may lead to confusion and uncertainty for FNOs.<br>7.      I appreciate that any legal advice to FNOs should be from a legal adviser. I am encouraged that the probation service (who employ community offender managers) is seeking to develop a cohort of probation officers specialising in FNOs and immigration. There are now 201 SPOCs across 12 regions and a hub lead developing this model and leading engagement with the SSHD. There is no such model in the prison in respect of “prison offender managers” who also liaise with the SSHD about FNOs.<br><strong> </strong><br><strong><u>Delays by SSHD and Probation and failure to obtain information.</u></strong><br><strong> </strong><br>8.      I am concerned at the potential impact of delays/failure to obtain information in other cases. In Mr Santos’ case there were delays by probation in allocating a community offender manager and providing an up-to-date OASYS report. There were also delays by the SSHD progressing Mr Santos’ case, including issue of the Stage 2 letter, failure to obtain medical records and delay in requesting the OASYS report.<br>9.      I am encouraged that there is now a centralised system (and form) for the SSHD to request OASYS reports from probation although it is not clear the extent to which requests are going through this system. Consent to obtain medical information is sought from FNOs at an induction meeting by Immigration Prison Teams (“IPTs”). Further IPT officers attend prisons and play a key role in obtaining this type of information. However it is not clear what systems are in place to facilitate the obtaining of medical information.<br><strong><u>The SSHD Internal report</u></strong><br><strong> </strong><br>10.    The SSHD disclosed an Internal report into Mr Santos’ case midway through the Inquest, which was not on his Home Office file. The lawyers representing the SSHD were unaware of this report. The head of FNO Returns Command only became aware of it the preceding week and understood it had been disclosed.<br>11.    The report detailed delays and issues in Mr Santos’ case and the SSHD then made formal admissions of the relevant (non-causative) failures which were recorded by the jury in the Record of Inquest at my direction.<br>12.    This report was dated February 2021 and listed action points for the relevant department. Although I am told that these are now being addressed, I am concerned that important learning points (which could prevent future deaths) were not disseminated and actioned as they should have been.<br><br><strong><u>Opening cell doors at night</u></strong><br>13.    In evidence there was a continued misunderstanding that the policy did not apply to Operational Support Grade (OSG) officers and it was understood that they should never open cell doors at night. This was despite the PPO report dated December 2021 (at paragraph 73) requesting this be addresses 14.    The prison stated in PFD evidence that all staff will be instructed as to the policy in terms of opening cell doors at night (which requires a dynamic risk assessment).<br>15.    I remain concerned that this appears to be a longstanding belief held by experienced officers.</td>",Coroner name: Jenny Goldring,Ref: 2023-0361,This report is being sent to: HMP Belmarsh | Practice Plus Group | Home Office | HM Prison and Probation Service | Ministry of Justice

This, of itself, does not place an individual into a high-risk category for the purposes of delivering the news that they are to be charged (by way of a PCR).<br><strong> </strong><br>·       That whether an individual is, exceptionally, considered to be in a high-risk category (such as to cause a PCR to be delivered in person) is reliant on information about their mental health coming to the attention of the OIC. There is no formal requirement for the OIC proactively to seek this information.<br><strong> </strong><br>·       That there is no formal process for assessing an individual’s mental health and/or risk of suicide or self-harm at the time of delivery of a PCR.<br><strong> </strong><br>It is important to note the following:<br><strong> </strong><br>·       At the point of charge, nothing has been proven against the individual concerned. They face an allegation, and are innocent if and until proven guilty to the criminal standard.<br><strong> </strong><br>·       Many people are RUI’d. As such, PCR is now routinely used to bring most criminal charges.<br><strong> </strong><br>·       Individuals who have been RUI’d can remain with this status for long periods of time (months or years) before a decision is made whether or not to charge them.<br><strong> </strong><br>·       Whilst there are formal procedures to assess an individual’s mental health and risk of self-harm or suicide when they attend a<br>police station for interview, once they have left the police station there are no such formal procedures (as above), notwithstanding the potential for a substantial period to elapse between the time they last attended a police station and the time that they are charged.<br><strong> </strong><br>·       Being charged with any criminal offence, especially one which carries the potential for a custodial sentence, can, self-evidently, have a significant deleterious effect on an individual’s mental health.<br><strong> </strong><br>It appears to me that, in the absence of a formal mechanism to assess, at the time of being charged, an individual’s mental health and risk of suicide or self-harm, there is an obvious risk of individuals in the future taking their own lives as a result of being charged by way of a PCR (potentially following a lengthy period of having been RUI’d and potentially months or years since there was last any consideration by the police of their mental health and risk of suicide or self-harm).<br><strong> </strong><br>In Mr Leger’s case, the relevant policies and procedures were those of the Metropolitan Police.

"<td class=""govuk-table__cell""><strong>CORONER’S CONCERNS</strong>   <br>During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.     <br><br>The <strong>MATTERS OF CONCERN </strong>are as follows:<br> <br>1.       There continues to be a chronic lack of resources to treat seriously mentally ill patients in Birmingham and Solihull. In the summer of 2022 Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Trust (‘BSMHFT’) wanted to admit the deceased to an inpatient psychiatric unit, however, no bed was available, and he remained in the community. Shortly before his death, the deceased had been detained by the police under section 136 of the mental health act. There was no available ‘place of safety’ and he had to be taken to an emergency department. The police, BSMHFT, and hospital Drs agreed the deceased needed to be assessed under the mental health act, however Birmingham City Council could not provide an approved mental health practitioner (‘AMPH’) to attend in a 24-hour period. When the section 136 lapsed the deceased was discharged home after a review by a mental health nurse. At the time of his death the deceased was on BSMHFT’s waiting list for a care- coordinator. The lack of care-coordinators, mental health inpatient beds, ‘place of safety’, and AMHPs, presents a risk seriously mentally ill people are not receiving necessary treatment. The evidence is that these issues are a consequence of a chronic lack of resources at a local and national level. The Birmingham and Solihull coroners have been repeating identical concerns in Prevention of Future Death Reports for many years.<br><br>2.       BSMHFT utilizes self-contained specialist teams. The deceased was treated by (a) crisis team/home treatment team, (b) community mental health team, and (b) psychiatric liaison team. The evidence demonstrated communication between the specialist teams was not effective and this caused delays. For example, the psychiatric liaison team nurse that reviewed the deceased updated the community mental health team. However, the GP could not prescribe the deceased’s medication in October 2022 because it had not been approved by the community mental health team consultant via an ESCA and the deceased went without his medication. The deceased’s GP had to contact the community mental health team directly notwithstanding the psychiatric liaison nurse’s involvement. The deceased cited this delay as making his mental health worse shortly before his death. My concern is communication between the specialist teams is not effective enough. BSMHFT’s RCA action plan is to seek assurance from the CCG/ICB that communication between the specialist teams is being strengthened. My concern is that this does not go far enough and there should be consideration of a formal process or policy.<br><br>3.       Carbamazepine management was proposed in 2012 to manage the deceased’s mental health however this was not picked up by his GP and was only noted by a BSMHFT consultant in August 2022. Therefore, the deceased went 10 years without this medication. BSMHFT could not explain at the inquest why this omission had not been identified sooner. BSMHFT’s RCA action plan does not have any action to avoid a repeat occurrence. My concern is this issue indicates a problem with process and systems and further consideration is required to avoid a repeat occurrence.<br><br>4.       The deceased’s GP raised concerns that different health organisations use different digital systems that do not communicate with each other. Further, GPs often do not get important patient updates from primary care organisations for many days or weeks. (See examples above: the GP did not pick up the carbamazepine prescription, and could not prescribe the medication in October 2022). My concern is communication between different health organisations is not as effective as it could be and important information is being missed, and consequently a material delay in treatment is occurring.<br><br>5.       The deceased’s GP raised concerns that current resources do not allow GPs to pro- actively check patients are collecting prescribed medication due to excessive patient lists. My concern is that this is a consequence of lack of resources at a national level.<br> <br>In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken.

"<td class=""govuk-table__cell""><strong>Matters of Concern</strong><br><strong> </strong><br>1. The generic, tick-box style of history recording by CATT which does not paint a full and proper picture of the mental health of the patient, especially compared to the assessments of psychiatric liaison, are such that risk may be unrecorded and under appreciated by CATT and patients thus be put at risk.<br><strong> </strong><br>2. That the role of CATT to look for alternatives to admission may risk CATT discharging patients who would benefit from admission and risk the repeat of making treatment plans that had recently failed such as in this case. Rather than looking for admission alternatives being a core function, should CATT rather better be focussed on the best treatment plan for the individual patient and thus admission being viewed as a clear option where appropriate rather a last resort, as it often appears to be presented in such cases before the coroner?<br><strong> </strong><br>3. That the provision of care-coordinators be increased and improved so that patients who require them have ready access at the time of need and are not placed on a waiting list.<br><strong> </strong><br>4. That patients to be discharged by CATT, as well as patients to be admitted are discussed with the on-call psychiatrist so that plans may be reviewed, and thus the risk of not admitting patients who would benefit from and/ or require admission such as Mr Khala, are less likely to be discharged inappropriately.<br><strong> </strong><br>5.

The evidence showed that Mr. Ashton had, at times, used a number of ways to protect himself from the potential of excessive losses from, and excessive deposits into, his online account, in order to gamble. Those methods included self-exclusion, temporary or permanent, from certain products and/or activities and placing limits on the value of his deposits and/or losses, during a specific, pre-determined period of time.<br> <br>During the ‘relevant period’ examined closely during the investigation and inquest, between July 2019 and the date of Mr. Ashton’s death on 22 April 2021, although Mr. Ashton utilised a number of what are known as ‘player protection tools’, as outlined above, the operator he was gambling with during the relevant period, Betfair, did not take any measures, save for sending a number of e-mails to Mr. Ashton, to tell him about the existence of a number of protection tools that players could potentially access. During the relevant period, the evidence showed that Mr. Ashton was a problem gambler and, in the last 10-12 weeks of his life, his problem gambling became more acute, intrusive and, on balance, distressing to him.<br> <br><strong><u>Concerns</u></strong><br>1)    I remain concerned that the player protection tools, as mentioned above, were and are inadequate to protect a person such as Mr. Ashton, who was a problem gambler with a worsening problem, specifically that such tools do not amount to any or any meaningful interaction with the gambler, or any intervention into the practices of the gambler.<br> <br>2)     I remain concerned that the algorithm devised and operated by Betfair, to assist its staff in, amongst other things, observing and monitoring the gambling patterns and practices of its customers, failed to flag up Mr. Ashton as a problem gambler, despite the increases in his time online (gambling) the value of his deposits and the size of his losses, in part because his gambling practices, even in the last 10-12 weeks of his life, were deemed not to be exceptional, when averaged among gambling customers, generally.<br> <br>3)     I remain concerned that, as was apparent through the evidence of a senior employee witness during the course of the inquest, the operator Betfair appears to judge the extent of its responsibilities to gambling customers solely with regard to industry (regulatory) standards, rather than current good or best practice in order to prevent further harming problem gamblers, or those who, as a result of their changing practices and patterns are likely to become problem gamblers.</td>",Coroner name: Ivan Cartwright,Ref: 2023-0238,"This report is being sent to: Betfair, Gambling Commission and Department for Culture, Media and Sport"

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.<br><br>The <strong>MATTERS OF CONCERN </strong>are as follows:<br><br><strong><u>Pre-amble</u></strong><br>The inquest heard evidence that Miss Zarins had suffered with depression since 2008. She managed this by taking anti-depressant medication intermittently, she stopped taking her anti-depressants in June/July 2021.<br><br>Miss Zarins came under the care of Leicestershire Partnership NHS Trust (“LPT”) on 22 November 2021, after taking an intentional overdose the day before. Miss Zarins was initially under the care of LPT’s Mental Health Liaison team but was transferred to the care of LPT’s CRISIS Team when she returned to her home address on 22 November 2021. Miss Zarins expressed a desire to work with the CRISIS team and to recommence anti-depressants as soon as possible in order to improve her mental health.<br><br>On 23 November 2021 Miss Zarins was discussed at a Multi-Disciplinary Team (“MDT”) meeting at LPT. The discussions at that meeting were fundamentally flawed, as was the plan for Miss Zarins’ care moving forward that was formed at that meeting and then implemented. The meeting proceeded on the basis that Miss Zarins was on, and had been on, anti-depressant medication at the time of taking the overdose, this was incorrect.<br><br>The second and final MDT meeting where Miss Zarins was discussed (on 24 November 2021) also proceeded on this same mistaken basis.<br><br>Despite Miss Zarins verbalising both her desire to get more sleep and her desire to go back onto anti-depressants as soon as possible, neither sleeping tablets nor anti-depressants were prescribed to her by LPT before she died. LPT continued to advise Miss Zarins that she would have to wait until 30 November 2021 to have a medical review.<br><br>A member of LPT staff who was present at both MDT meetings informed the inquest that he did not have time to read the notes of the patients that were to be discussed at the MDT meetings. The staff member had not read Miss Zarins’ core assessment documentation (which correctly stated she was not on any anti-depressants) before either MDT meeting.<br><br>Evidence heard at inquest was that Miss Zarins should have been put back onto anti- depressants and prescribed sleeping tablets on 23 November 2021.<br><br>LPT undertook a Serious Incident Investigation into the care provided to Miss Zarins before her death. The investigation was wholly inadequate. Issues include, but are not limited to:<br>1.  There was no medical input into the investigation;<br>2. The investigation failed to explore appropriately the functionality of the MDT meetings;<br>3. The investigation failed to identify the error in understanding of the Miss Zarins’ medication position;<br>4. Due to the fact that the investigation failed to identify the error relating to the understanding of the medication position, the investigation also failed to identify the fact that the treatment plan that was implemented was flawed. The investigation failed to identify the fact that Miss Zarins should have been recommenced on anti- depressants and prescribed sleeping tablets before her death.<br> <br>Notwithstanding the inadequacy of the Serious Incident report the document accepts that, whilst the anti-depressants would not have had an immediate impact on Miss Zarins’ mood, the thought of having to wait a week for this medication may have added to her sense of hopelessness. This was echoed by witnesses at the inquest. I also accept, on the balance of probabilities, and when considered alongside Miss Zarins’ clear desire to recommence her anti-depressants in order to get better, that the fact she was told she had to wait a week for  a medical review would have added to her sense of hopelessness.<br> <br><strong><u>Concerns</u></strong><br>1)          I am concerned about the CRISIS team MDT meetings and their functionality. It is difficult to understand how a meeting attended by around 7 people agreed a treatment plan which was based upon incorrect information relating to the patient’s medication status. This is particularly difficult to understand when the correct medication status is clearly documented in the patient’s core assessment paperwork (which was completed by the Liaison Team on 22 November 2021 and sent to the CRISIS Team).<br> <br>An LPT staff member was candid about the fact that he did not have enough time to review patients’ records before the MDT meetings, this is a grave concern.<br> <br>2)          I remain concerned about both the standard of documentation and lack of documentation relating to the discussion of Miss Zarins at the two MDT meetings. The Trust were only able to provide me with documentation relating to one of the two MDT meetings. That documentation is incorrectly completed and lacks detail. In particular, there is no detail about medication despite there being a specific box within which to document this.<br> <br>This problem of poor and/or missing documentation is not a risk that is limited to the CRISIS Team, it is one that could have ramifications not only across the Trust but across all of the bodies who come together to provide care for patients.<br> <br>3)          I remain gravely concerned about the inadequacies in the Serious Incident Investigation and Reporting processes at Leicestershire Partnership NHS Trust.<br> <br>The Serious Incident Investigation failed to identify the errors in the care provided to Miss Zarins making the use of the process somewhat otiose in this case. The failure to properly investigate led to the wholly untenable situation where errors in care were uncovered for the first time at inquest, which took place some 20 months after the date of death (due to witness availability).<br> <br>I am concerned that the lack of robust critical analysis and investigation of the care provided to Miss Zarins before her death has caused a delay to, and led to missed opportunities (for some staff) to learn lessons that are vital to patient safety.<br> <br>My concerns relating to the inadequacy of the Trust Serious Incident Investigations and the risks related to that go far beyond just the care provided by the CRISIS Team.

That was not caused by those individuals who had provided written statements to the Court or the two who attended to provide oral evidence.<br> <br>Whilst the Inquest hearing did not identify actions/omissions on the part of individuals/teams within the Council which more than minimally, negligibly or trivially contributed to Leah’s death, the concern is that Bradford Council appeared not to have a system/process in place which allowed anyone (whether an individual / a team) within the Council to have an overview of deaths where there had been previous Council involvement with the deceased (in this case a child).<br> <br>In the apparent absence of such oversight Bradford Council would not be able to learn lessons from such cases (or even know if there were lessons to be learned).

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.<br><strong> </strong><br>The <strong>MATTERS OF CONCERN</strong> are as follows. <br><br>1.     The inquest heard evidence that the backlogs for therapy were such that the waiting list at the time she was assessed as being appropriate for step 4 therapy had a two year wait time. Since that time the waiting period had not decreased and was now between 2 -3 years in both primary and secondary care. This was due to a shortage of trained therapists and demands on the service and was a national issue not specific to the CWP trust.<br><strong> </strong><br>2.     The inquest was told that the trust had since Michelle’s death recognised that the lack of ownership created through the application of its referral and discharge policy internally carried an unacceptable risk. Significant changes had been made. However it was unclear if nationally the lesson had been shared and that other mental health trusts had taken similar steps.<br><br>3.     The evidence before the inquest was that there needed to be a clear understanding by all prosecuting authorities of the impact of a prosecution on someone with a complex mental health background such as Michelle. In Michelle’s case the BTP file reviewer (the nature of the offence Michelle faced meant that it was not a CPS lawyer who made the charging decision) had not correctly applied the public interest test and had not considered the mental health/vulnerability of Michelle Jennings as required to. As a consequence a decision was taken to prosecute her without an assessment of the impact on Michelle and her case was dealt with by the Magistrates Court without them being given the full background in relation to her deteriorating mental health. BTP are as a consequence of Michelle’s death taking steps to address how their prosecution teams should deal with the public interest test and gather information where mental health is an issue. However there is no clear mechanism for such learning and changes (to reduce the risk to life) in relation to vulnerable people such as Michelle to be implemented within the other 42 Police Forces in England and Wales or within other agencies responsible for prosecuting criminal offences.</td>",Coroner name: Alison Mutch,Ref: 2023-0220,This report is being sent to: Department of Health and Social Care and Ministry of Justice

I was shocked when I listened to the recording of the call that [REDACTED] made to the crisis line the day before his daughter died.<br><strong> </strong><br>The East London NHS Foundation Trust (ELFT) serious incident (SI) report observed that the clinician did not elicit clear risks during the conversation; did not listen to [REDACTED] ; talked over him; did not appear empathic; and dismissed his distress about his daughter, even though she was a patient known to services after a first episode of psychosis.<br><strong> </strong><br>In reaching my conclusion at inquest that the call was not treated with the seriousness it deserved, I agreed with all of those observations. [REDACTED] was not taken seriously, he was not treated respectfully and he was not treated kindly. He was clearly desperate about his daughter’s mental health and, as we now know, he was right to be desperate. He rang the crisis line and he was belittled.<br><strong> </strong><br>The clinician then made no note of the call in the medical records, even retrospectively.<br><strong> </strong><br>I note the many recommendations of the thoughtful SI report, but I remain concerned on three counts.<br><strong> </strong><br>· This is not the first time that I have made a PFD report to ELFT about its crisis line.<br><strong> </strong><br>· Not only did the clinician in question not make a note of the call in the medical record, he told me in court that, after Freeda Glausiusz’s death his manager had told him not to make an appropriately dated retrospective note in the record. He said that he had made a note on a piece of paper, but he did not now have that piece of paper.<br><strong> </strong><br>When I asked the lead SI reviewer if the trust is confident that it has taken all appropriate actions in respect of that clinician, she was not able to give me that assurance.<br><br>2. I heard at inquest that the clinician and his manager had listened to the recording of the call within days of the death and had recognised very significant shortcomings. However, the recording was not then volunteered to my coroner’s officer. I was aware of the existence of the call only because [REDACTED] told my officer about it.<br><strong> </strong><br>· I received a copy of the recording of the call (without a transcript) the day before the inquest.<br><strong> </strong><br>· I received a statement from the clinician who took the call the day before the inquest.<br><strong> </strong><br>· I received statements from other ELFT clinicians in dribs and drabs earlier this month.<br><strong> </strong><br>· I received a copy of the SI report the day before the inquest.<br><strong> </strong><br>· I never received a copy of the 48 hour hot de-brief.<br><strong> </strong><br>· Freeda Glausiusz died five months ago. My officer first requested witness statements and a copy of any internal investigation on 7 June, over four months ago, and asked for the statements to be provided by 20 August.<br><strong> </strong><br>This chronology does not demonstrate an eagerness to promote a learning culture by ELFT. The failure to provide prompt and candid co-operation with my office obstructs the coronial inquiry, an inquiry that includes the function of learning from deaths.

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.<br> <br>The <strong>MATTERS OF CONCERN </strong>are as follows:<br>Patients who attend a Hospital Accident and Emergency Department with mental health difficulties are in most hospitals seen by a Mental Health Liaison team (made up of Consultant Psychiatrists and Mental Health nurses) These staff are not employed by the Acute Hospital Trust but are employed by a local Mental Health Trust (in this particular case it was the Sussex Partnership Foundation Trust).<br> <br>As a result of their employment status the Mental Health Liaison team (who have the best knowledge of the patient having been caring for them) cannot invoke the Doctors or Nurses holding powers under Section 5(2) Mental Health Act (Section 5(4) for nurses). If a patient decides to abscond from the Acute Trust Hospital the Mental Health staff cannot detain/hold the patient. They would have to ask a Doctor within the Acute Hospital to do so. This Doctor may not have any knowledge of the patient and would be unlikely to act immediately in a busy A&amp;E.

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.<br><strong> </strong><br>The <strong>MATTERS OF CONCERN </strong>are as follows. <br>1.      a. During the Inquest evidence was heard that Eifion’s GP had made a ‘very<br>urgent’ referral to the Single Point of Access and Allocation within BCUHB on 13 May 2022 indicating that on the background of attempts at ending his life, he was extremely concerned that Eifion was experiencing deterioration in his mental state. This document was contained within the hard copy set of notes held by the Psychiatric Liaison Team. When Eifion attended at the Emergency Department the following day, on 14 May 2022, the Emergency department staff were not aware of this ‘very urgent’ referral as they only had access to the electronic notes and not the hard copy notes. Had they been aware it is likely to have further informed their decision making. It is concerning that the process of ensuring electronic notes to allow for fully informed decisions around treatment and care based on all available records, is not available to staff. It was not clear at Inquest whether the transition from paper-based notes to electronic notes was a Health Board initiative or a nationally followed initiative. Either way, any delay in ensuring all notes are available electronically is potentially harmful to patients.<br><strong> </strong><br>b. During the evidence it was accepted that ‘a’ above was not a consideration for improvement as part of the Health Board’s investigation and so was not an action within the Action Plan upon which it could make improvements or plan to make improvements. It is surprising that the Health Board did not consider this as an issue which required further consideration and improvements in its learning and improvement.<br><strong> </strong><br>An investigation was commenced by the Health Board into Eifion’s death which appears to have been concluded in July 2022 but did not appear to be finalised and ready for sharing / disseminating until March 2023. I have previously issued Prevention of Future Death Reports to the Health Board pertaining to the lack of timeliness of their investigations, specifically in relation to investigations from deaths in 2020 and 2021. Whilst I have previously been advised of improvements into investigation processes in respect of more recent deaths the issue of timeliness remains. Eifion died in 2022 and yet the time it took for the investigation to be completed and shared, with actions undertaken has been too long.

"<td class=""govuk-table__cell""><strong>CORONER’S CONCERNS</strong><br>During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.<br><strong> </strong><br>The <strong>MATTERS OF CONCERN </strong>are as follows.<br><strong> </strong><br>1. When Ms Findlay ran off, the HCA escorting her was so panicked that she did not even think of following. Ms Findlay had run across a road and so chasing her at speed did present safety considerations. However, the ELFT policy, training, culture and expectation was such, that there the HCA did not at any point consider attempting to walk after her to keep her in sight. Clinical staff must be adequately prepared for such an eventuality.<br><strong> </strong><br>That means more than simply a change in policy wording.<br><br>2. By the time the HCA rang the duty senior nurse for advice Ms Findlay was out of sight, and so the HCA was instructed to return to the ward.<br><strong> </strong><br>I heard evidence that an email is to be sent out shortly to explain that a new ELFT absent without leave policy will be in place by the end of June 2023. The new policy will confirm that, if it is safe to do so an escort may follow a patient who has absconded, keeping them in line of sight whilst ringing the duty senior nurse for instructions.<br><strong> </strong><br>However, there is no ELFT policy for what those instructions should be or even what they could include. No member of ELFT gave evidence of any organisational thought having gone into how then to progress such a situation, other than the ward calling the police to report a missing person. No member of ELFT giving evidence was able to set out what the staff member following should do.<br><strong> </strong><br>This appears to be a significant omission.<br><strong> </strong><br>3. Moreover, one of the MPS policy leads in this area gave evidence that in such a situation the police would not necessarily attend, even if called direct by a hospital staff member in the street following a patient about whom they are worried.<br><strong> </strong><br>I spent some time examining the police regarding this point, and I was left with the impression that a clinician calling the police in what the clinician perceived to be an emergency situation might not be assisted by the police.<br><strong> </strong><br>That concerned me.<br><strong> </strong><br>4. I heard that Right Care, Right Person is an operational model developed by Humberside Police that changes the way the emergency services respond to calls involving concerns about mental health. I understand that it is in the process of being rolled out across the UK as part of ongoing work between police forces, health providers and government.<br><strong> </strong><br>I heard that the MPS has already created a similar model under the resource and demand team. The protocol is called Affinity. It attempts to target preventable demand from the mental health trusts.<br><strong> </strong><br>I was told that ELFT and the MPS work in partnership, so I asked the MPS what is meant to happen if an escort is following a patient who has run away and about whom the escort is worried.<br><strong> </strong><br>I was told that this is primarily a health problem. It was pointed out that doctors, nurses and other hospital staff have the same powers as the police under section 18 of the Mental Health Act. Hospital employees have the legal authority to take a sectioned patient into custody and return them to hospital.<br><strong> </strong><br>However, I heard nothing of an ELFT protocol that would advise staff on the ward to come out to assist an escort who already following a patient. I heard nothing of a trust contingency plan that would allow a ward to function without the doctors and nurses needed to undertake such a task. I heard nothing of any training given to doctors and nurses in how to restrain a patient in the middle of the street and to transport them back to the ward.<br><strong> </strong><br>From the evidence I heard, the police / health trust partnership working allows each agency to regard such a situation as the other’s responsibility, whilst nobody is on the ground attempting to retrieve a seriously ill patient who is meant to be inside a locked ward for their own safety.<br><strong> </strong><br>Whether this is a matter of policy or practice, the result is the same. If partner agency working is to be effective in caring for this extremely vulnerable cohort of patients, there needs to be crystal clear understanding by all those involved, from the highest policy maker to the most junior member of a team at the sharp end, of how to tackle these difficult situations and exactly who is meant to be doing what.<br><strong> </strong><br>5. Evidence was given that the police classify a person at high risk as: the risk is immediate and there are substantial grounds for believing immediate risk of self harm.<br><strong> </strong><br>I was told by the MPS that, at the time of reporting to the MPS, trusts should volunteer their own grading of the patient’s risk. The police said that they will not necessarily following the trust grading, but they regard it as a significant factor and it should form part of the MPS thinking. ELFT witnesses told me that if the police did not ask for the trust’s grading then the trust would not offer it.<br><strong> </strong><br>I was told that, until April 2022 the grab pack prepared by ELFT for the MPS in such a situation was printed out and handed to police if &amp; when the police attended the ward. It is now filled out on a portal as part of the reporting procedure. However, it is not clear to me how far the grab pack aligns with local policies, whether all useful information (including the trust’s grading of risk) is recorded as a matter of routine, and how far the police and the trust are using the same terminology with the same definitions.<br><strong> </strong><br>It seems that this would benefit from consideration.<strong> </strong><br><br>6. ELFT staff all told me that, after Ms Findlay had run off, they still graded her as medium rather than high risk. She had had long term suicidal thoughts, had made previous attempts on her life and, prior to being admitted to hospital on 20 May 2020 had purchased sodium nitrate and had planned to take this to kill herself. However, she had appeared to improve in hospital, and had been granted 15 minutes’ escorted leave twice a day since 1 June without incident.<br><strong> </strong><br>At one point in her evidence it appeared to me that the matron, taking the point that by running away Ms Findlay had acted in a manner that was wholly unexpected by the trust, was of the view that Ms Findlay should then have been re-categorised as high risk. However, following re-examination by counsel for ELFT the matron appeared to retract this and to return to her former position that, even after she had run away Ms Findlay was only of medium risk to herself.<br><strong> </strong><br>It is of course a matter of clinical opinion what risk grading a patient should be given, and no person can see into the future.<br><strong> </strong><br>However,<br>· the jury found a failure by ELFT to recognise that, by 11 June 2020, Ms Findlay was at imminent risk of suicide by sodium nitrate; and<br>· any investigation following a death like Heather Findlay’s presents an opportunity for sober and searching reflection.<br><strong> </strong><br>So I am concerned that an element of positional bias may have influenced the thinking of ELFT staff.<br><strong> </strong><br>I am concerned about this particularly because, when giving evidence at inquest, the ELFT serious incident investigation author was adamant that it was only appropriate for the HCA who called the police on 11 June 2020 after Ms Findlay had run away, to tell the police of a risk of self harm not of a risk of suicide. Her rationale for this was that the last time Ms Findlay had articulated a plan to kill herself, was when she was found in hospital with a ligature round her neck on 28 May 2020.<br><strong> </strong><br>This position seems lacking the necessary reflection.<br><strong> </strong><br>I draw your attention to earlier prevention of future deaths reports (PFDs) as follows:<br><strong> </strong><br>· Sent to ELFT on 8 June 2023 by Assistant Coroner Buckett following the inquest touching the death of Hilary (Billy) Guedalla, including concern regarding the failure of ELFT to inform the police of the serious suicide risk that the deceased posed to themselves; and the confusion among staff about who should be contacted and in what manner, once a patient was found to be missing.<br><strong> </strong><br>· Sent to ELFT on 25 January 2023 by me following the inquest touching the death of Andrew Largin, including concern about omissions from a serious incident investigation.<br><strong> </strong><br>· Sent to ELFT on 20 October 2021 by me following the inquest touching the death of Freeda Glausiusz, including concern about a lack of learning culture at ELFT.</td>",Coroner name: Mary Hassell,Ref: 2023-0193,"This report is being sent to: East London NHS Foundation Trust, Metropolitan Police Service, NHS England and Home Department"

He told the inquest that he was expecting mental health services in Worcestershire to arrange a further urgent assessment of Mr. Harper, and he therefore ensured that Mr. Harper was told to expect the Crisis Team to contact him to arrange a further assessment.<br><br>(2)   The Clinical Lead for the Crisis Team in Worcestershire gave evidence to the inquest that whilst the Crisis Team did receive a request from the nurse at Gloucester that night, they interpreted it only as a request for further assessment ( but not an urgent one ), and not as a request that Mr. Harper be referred to the Home Treatment Team.<br><br>(3)   In the event, an urgent assessment was not arranged, and Mr. Harper’s case was only considered by the Home Treatment Team in Worcestershire when his temporary GP in Worcestershire, out of further concern for Mr. Harper’s mental health, made a new and separate referral to them.<br><br>(4)   I have concluded that the events described above arose out of a lack of understanding between the two NHS Trusts concerned ( Herefordshire &amp; Worcestershire Health and Care NHS Trust ( HWHCT ) and Gloucestershire Health and Care NHS Trust ( GHCT ) ) as to how each other’s mental health services are run – otherwise arrangements would have been made for Mr. Harper’s mental health to be assessed urgently, as was intended.<br><br>(5) If staff at HWHCT and GHCT do not understand how to make urgent mental health referrals or requests for urgent mental health assessments to each other, there remains a risk that other deaths may occur in similar circumstances in the future.</td>",Coroner name: David Reid,Ref: 2023-0179,This report is being sent to: Herefordshire and Worcestershire Healthy and Care NHS Trust and Gloucestershire Health and Care NHS Foundation Trust

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.<br><strong> </strong><br>The <strong>MATTERS OF CONCERN </strong>are as follows. <strong> </strong><br>1.     5 NHS Trusts and 3 police forces in different geographic areas had contact with Patrick in the final month of his life and each thereby gained some information about the risk to him. However, that information was by reason of the agencies falling into different geographic areas. There was no single effective global focus for the information being acquired piecemeal about Patrick’s pattern of serious self-harming behaviour. The various agencies were significantly impeded in forming a single clear picture of Patrick’s pattern of behaviour (which was particularly necessary in circumstances where he was not engaging and therefore not assisting in providing a complete history himself).<br><strong> </strong><br>2.     GPs act as a repository for information about contact with other clinical agencies (such as attendances at accident and emergency departments) and therefore serve as a point of contact for information about past history. However, I heard evidence at inquest from accident and emergency consultants that it is either not possible to access information held by a GP practice out of GP surgery hours or where it is possible to do so that is only available if the GP is in the same<br>geographic area as the accident and emergency department. Several of<br><br>Patrick’s attendances at accident and emergency departments were out of GP surgery hours.<br><strong> </strong><br>3.     I was informed at inquest that one local authority (in whose area Patrick resided) had been made aware by police of the risk to Patrick following one of his self- harm incidents (in respect of a particularly important piece of information) and had relayed that information to a 6th NHS Trust (not one of the 5 from which I heard evidence at inquest) but Patrick did not reside in that Trust area. Those Trusts which did have direct contact with Patrick were never made aware of that piece of information nor had any means of accessing it.<br><strong> </strong><br>4.     I heard evidence that there is no national ‘risk flagging’ system: for example, when a person attends an accident and emergency department having self- harmed, the fact of a previous self-harm attendance at a different accident and emergency department is not systematically flagged up.<br><strong> </strong><br>5.     In summary, there was no single effective global focus consolidating the information which was flowing into the various agencies about Patrick; no global focus to which those agencies could in turn refer in emergency to obtain the totality of information about Patrick’s recent pattern of behaviour; no national ‘risk flagging’ system to alert those agencies to his significant recent history.</td>",Coroner name: Edmund Gritt,Ref: 2023-0124,This report is being sent to: Department of Health and Social Care and NHS England

Furthermore, in those 2½ years there was a 5 month period when Charlotte had no appointed care coordinator at all. The care coordinator role is particularly important for a patient with such a complex case history as Charlotte.<br> <br>I heard evidence that at the time of these events, the Trust had been experiencing an unprecedented level of instability, with many staff who might have been expected to fulfil care coordinator roles going off sick or even leaving the service. The witness who had conducted the Trust’s own internal investigation into these events gave evidence that one of the major reasons for this instability was that staff were unable to cope with ever-increasing workloads. The Trust’s Community Services manager for the Worcestershire Neighbourhood Teams appeared to corroborate this in his evidence, confirming that whilst national guidelines recommend a maximum of 30 patients per care coordinator, at the time of these events the Trust’s care coordinators had around 100 patients each. Whilst he was able to provide some reassurance that a recent recruitment drive has reduced individual care coordinator caseloads to around 25 patients, he was unable to explain how individual caseloads had been able to reach the levels they did at the time of these events, and was unable to give accurate figures as to current levels of staff sickness/absence.<br> <br>I am concerned that the Trust is unable to understand fully how the care coordinator system failed at the time of these events, and that it is therefore not in a position to guard against a repeat of these circumstances in the future.<br> <br>(2) The erroneous decision to pause Charlotte’s referral to the Priory Hospital for specialist treatment for Body Dysmorphic Disorder was taken by a senior clinician acting on her own, despite a Multi-Disciplinary Team meeting having decided that the referral was appropriate. When asked about how the senior clinician could have overridden the MDT decision, the Trust’s Community Services manager for the Worcestershire Neighbourhood Teams told the inquest that he could not say whether the senior clinician was not aware of the correct decision-making procedure, or whether she was, but chose instead to ignore it. When asked whether the same issue could arise in future, he told the inquest that he himself would be in a position to prevent the senior clinician making the wrong decision, but could not guarantee that he would be made aware of the issue so as to be able to do so.<br> <br>I am concerned that the Trust has not properly established how the senior clinician was able to override the MDT decision, and does not have a sufficiently robust system in place to ensure that MDT decisions cannot be overridden in this way in future.</td>",,,
"<td class=""govuk-table__cell""><strong><u>CORONER’S CONCERNS</u></strong> <br>During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.<br> <br>The <strong>MATTERS OF CONCERN </strong>are as follows. –<br>1.  A multitude of factors contributed to Mr. Singh’s death across the custodial and healthcare teams within HMP Birmingham. Many steps have been taken by all organisations with responsibility for Mr. Singh’s safety and health during his time at HMP Birmingham to rectify failings that have been identified such as the consistent failure to use interpreters, poor communication and record keeping within and between teams, the absence of meaningful engagement with Mr. Singh’s family, insufficient consideration of family concerns and failings in the use of the ACCT system.<br><br>2. Much of the evidence at the inquest focused on the central issue of repeated missed opportunities to identify that Mr. Singh required admission to the prison’s inpatient ward, ward 2, and assessment for section 48 transfer to a medium secure unit (which would have been likely to result in transfer to a medium secure unit). The consequences of the failure to transfer Mr. Singh to an inpatient setting were compounded by the fact that he was not taken onto the mental health team’s caseload promptly and therefore did not have the benefit of an allocated CPN and the oversight and input of a mental health multi-disciplinary team. Many steps have been undertaken by Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Trust (who provide mental health services within the prison) to minimise the risk of such a situation occurring again.<br><br>3. However, there are two features of the mental health care provided to Mr. Singh that create a risk to the lives of others that have not yet been rectified:<br>i.  the fact that the mental health team multi-disciplinary team (MDT) does not include a psychiatrist; and<br>ii. the absence of any ongoing risk assessment documentation for patients with mental illness within the SystemOne records at HMP Birmingham.<br><br>4.  In Mr. Singh’s case it is my conclusion that it is likely that if a psychiatrist had been at a mental health MDT meeting held on the 19th January 2022 they would have identified that he needed to be admitted to ward 2 without further delay. At the very least the need for urgent review by a psychiatrist and CPN would have been recognised and facilitated which would in turn have led to admission. CPNs in Mr. Singh’s case continually failed to identify the significance of repeatedly and consistently reported psychotic symptoms and consequently he did not receive adequate assessment and treatment which increased his risk of self harm and suicide which in turn was not sufficiently identified. The absence of a psychiatrist at the MDT creates a risk that the significance of some symptoms and presentations will not be recognised and further deaths could occur due to lack of appropriate assessment and treatment.<br><br>5. Other electronic health care records systems used in mental health settings have a rolling risk assessment document that clinicians are required to review and update at certain points in a patient’s management. The risk assessment document provides a prompt to clinicians to formally consider risk and come to a reasoned, documented conclusion that then feeds into decision making. The record also provides a reliable, easily accessible source of risk history. No such facility is in use on SystemOne at HMP Birmingham. Further, the evidence given was that such a system is not being used routinely across mental health care within the prison estate and is not provided as standard on SystemOne. This creates an ongoing risk to life arising from under-estimation of risk as a result of clinicians not formally considering and assessing current risk levels, and salient risk history not being easily accessible. It is understood by Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Trust that it should be possible to create a specific risk assessment record within SystemOne and this is being considered locally. However, the evidence given was that this issue should be highlighted nationally and that the developers and distributors of SystemOne should be involved so as to ensure the best available solution is identified.</td>",,,

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.<br><br><strong>The <strong>MATTERS OF CONCERN </strong>are as follows. –<br></strong>The Inquest heard evidence from the Head of Service for Safeguarding and Learning for Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council. She highlighted a long-standing gap in provision, which was described as extending across most if not all local authorities, for vulnerable adults who have complex needs, but who do not fall into the existing framework of social services, Care Act provision or formal mental health supervision. The effect of that gap is that there is no identifiable individual who is a single point of contact in such cases equivalent to a social worker or care coordinator. The result is that many vulnerable adults with complex needs have no such arrangements in place for contact, collating and sharing of information and deployment of services and assistance, support or safeguarding. Where such arrangements are in place, they are necessarily ad hoc in nature in differing frameworks, levels and standards, and can devolve by default to an individual who, whilst well-motivated, may lack the skills and training to properly perform the function, particularly when the vulnerable adult may be in crisis<strong>.</strong></td>",,,

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.<br><br>The MATTERS OF CONCERN in relation to on-line prescribing are as follows:<br>(1)   Whilst each individual pharmacy had in-house safety checks to safeguard against over­ prescribing by their own pharmacy, there is no integrated system in place which would alert a prescriber to prescriptions that have been dispensed by other on-line pharmacies. As a result, it is currently possible for a patient to obtain excessive quantities of medication by simply placing multiple orders with different on-line pharmacists.<br> <br>(2)   There is no requirement for the on-line pharmacies to share information with the patient’s GP. This means that, in the absence of the patient’s consent to share information, the online prescriber is reliant on the accuracy and truthfulness of the history provided by the patient.<br> <br>(3)   Lack of information sharing also creates a risk that a GP or Pharmacist Prescriber may unwittingly prescribe a medication that is contraindicated with a medication that has been dispensed through an on-line pharmacy.<br> <br>The MATTERS OF CONCERN in relation to the provision of mental health care on Griffin Ward are as follows: <br>(1)  The Recovery &amp; Discharge Plans contained inaccurate information regarding Ania’s consent to share information with her mother. The evidence was that this was an entry made in error in June 2020 and was not picked up by any of the nurses who updated the Recovery &amp; Discharge Plan over the subsequent 11 months.<br> <br>(2)   The Recovery &amp; Discharge Plans did not address the risks associated with Ania’s procurement of Propranolol from on-line pharmacies. The evidence was that an update of the Recovery &amp; Discharge Plan involved members of nursing staff simply adding a note that the overdoses had taken place. The Plan did not show that any meaningful thought had been given to addressing the particular <strong>risk </strong>associated with the procurement of on-line medication.<br> <br>(3) Mandatory refresher training on basic aspects of nursing care such as record keeping, searches, care-planning, undertaking pre- and post-leave assessments and confidentiality is not provided to staff. <br><br>(4) There is no requirement for the outcome of negative personal searches to be documented in the records and consequently there is no ability to effectively audit whether searches are taking place and the treating team are unable to assess a patient’s level of compliance with rules around bringing contraband items onto the ward.<br><br>(5) Searches undertaken of Ania’s room following the overdoses on 10 March and 5 June 2021 were ineffective and did not uncover the Propranolol that Ania had been stockpiling.<br><br>(6) Documentation on which 1:5 observations are recorded does not evidence that a check has taken place every 5 minutes. Instead the current documentation, simply requires one signature per hour. There is therefore no mechanism by which observations can be effectively audited.<br><br>(7) There is no requirement to make a separate entry evidencing that a post-leave assessment has been undertaking.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.<br><br> The MATTER OF CONCERN is as follows:<br><br>The Commission for Human Medicine (CHM) established an lsotretinoin Expert Working Group (IEWG) in response to concerns about psychiatric events. The IEWG considered oral and written evidence over 2020 and 2021. The findings and recommendations of the IEWG were presented in a report to the CHM at the end of 2021 and include a recommendation which relates to prescribing for patients under the age of 18. <strong> </strong><br><br> It is now over a year since the IEWG report was completed and the recommendations have still not been implemented. In that time there have been 45 adverse lsotretinion events reported to the Medicines Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) comprising of 81 psychiatric adverse events, one of which was an attempted suicide. The Court heard that a second working group is required to consider how to implement the IEWG recommendations and that this group has yet to meet.</td>",,,
"<td class=""govuk-table__cell""><strong><u>CORONER’S CONCERNS</u></strong><br>During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.<br><br>The <strong>MATTERS OF CONCERN </strong>are as follows. <br>1. During the course of the inquest reference was made to the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance “Autistic Spectrum disorder in under 19s: support and management.” Published on 28 August 2013 and in particular paragraph 1.1.4 which states that “<em>Local autism teams should ensure that every child or young person diagnosed with autism has a case manager or key worker to manage and coordinate treatment, care, support and transition to adult care in line with the NICE guideline on autism in children and young people (covering identification and diagnosis).</em>” Stefan did not have a case manager or key worker.<br><br>2. I am unable to say if the lack of a case manager or key worker caused or contributed more than minimally to Stefan’s death but had one been available they may have been able to assist Stefan and his family to navigate the services available which in turn may have led to intervention which may have made a difference. I am prohibited from returning a conclusion which comments on issues where there is no clear causal link with the death however the Coroner’s and<br>Justice Act 2009 creates a duty on Coroners to report an issue which gives rise to a concern which may lead to future deaths.<br><strong> </strong><br>3. I asked for further evidence on the provision of case managers/key workers in accordance with the NICE guidance after the inquest from North East London Foundation Trust and from Kent and Medway Integrated Care Board. It is clear from the evidence provided that such a service is only provided to those under 19 year olds who have both a learning disability and/or a diagnosis of autism and are at risk of admission to a mental health hospital or where there is a significant sudden deterioration in the community and the multi disciplinary team has not been responsive. The lowest level of service outlined in reply to the court indicated that referrals could be made to a key worker to sign post families not that they would have a key worker allocated to them. This sets the bar at a level which means a large number of young people with a learning disability and/or autism would not have a key worker nor would they be expected to have one.<br><br>4. In the evidence provided it was outlined that <em>“Keyworkers will make sure that these children, young people and families get the right support at the right time. They will make sure that local systems are responsive to fully meeting the young people’s needs in a joined-up way and that whenever it is possible to provide care and treatment in the community with the right support this becomes the norm.” </em>If every autistic child or young person had a key worker this would enable them or their family the opportunity to liaise with their key worker rather than having to try to navigate services themselves. This, in turn, may prevent others from encountering the issues faced by Stefan’s family and ultimately prevent future deaths.</td>",,,

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.<br> <br>The <strong>MATTERS OF CONCERN </strong>are as follows. <br>(1)    Continued staffing pressures within Primary Mental Health Services resulting in assessment delays and waiting lists for support e.g the waiting list for LPMHSS counselling remains at 4 – 6 months. There was no evidence that the waiting list would improve moving forward<br> <br>(2)    Whilst awaiting counselling, the only interim support available to patients that are assessed as mild or low risk, are services that come with a requirement to self-refer, despite lack of motivation being a common symptom.

This information was then relayed to the officers on the ground.<br><strong> </strong><br>Witnesses in this case stated that there is no standardised information sharing requirement or protocol for cross border missing persons investigations (including missing persons with suicidal ideation).<br><strong> </strong><br>I am concerned that, as there is no standardised information sharing requirements or protocols in such cases, in the future a force receiving details of a suicidal missing person may also not be informed that an individual has taken a means of suicide with them.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.<br> <br>The <strong>MATTERS OF CONCERN </strong>are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern)<br>1. Emergency Response<br> <br>I heard during the course of the inquest that when an alarm sounded staff would attend the location of the alarm, assess the situation and then go and collect what equipment may be necessary to deal with the emergency.<br> <br>At the time of Samantha’s death there was only 1 emergency bag for the entire hospital (which had 2 wards and separate self-contained flats on the site). This has now been rectified and there is an emergency bag for every ward.<br> <br>Staff partake in a drill and evidence provided to me for the purposes of Regulation 28 showed that response times of staff remain at 2 minutes to a patient’s side.<br> <br>However, I was told that the emergency response still has staff attend a patient, assess and then go and collect the emergency bag, rather than taking it immediately to the patient’s side.<br> <br>I was provided with evidence for the purposes of Regulation 28 by Inmind Healthcare Group which showed, for example, that in December of 2022 there were 64 incidents, 45 of which were self-harm, 2 of which were clinical incidents. 16 resulted in actual harm and a large number of those incidents concerned patients ligating.<br> <br>To continue with an emergency response which delays the provision of life saving equipment to the patients’ side is unsafe and in my opinion could lead to future deaths.<br> <br>The delay in providing CPR to Samantha on balance had no causative effect on her death, but it could for another patient.<br> <br>2. Observation Policy<br> <br>At the time of Samantha’s death observations were conducted and recorded in a predictable and prescriptive way by healthcare staff. The quality of observations recorded at the time of Samantha’s death were such that they did not accord with the expectation of the policy and merely recorded where the patient was and what they were doing.<br> <br>Effective observations were acknowledged as being a vital tool to assess and manage the risk of a patient.<br> <br>Inmind Healthcare Group’s new observation Policy states:<br> <br>‘Observations are a therapeutic intervention aimed at reducing factors which contribute to increased risk and promoting recovery. The use of enhanced observation levels should never be regarded as routine practice…….<br>Observation practice must focus on engaging the person therapeutically and enabling them to address their difficulties constructively. Our interactions must seek to create rapport which allows those in our care to feel valued and safe to share their experiences with us’.<br> <br>Since Samantha’s death changes have been made by Inmind Healthcare Group to their policy and practice, in that observations are now recorded at the precise time they are conducted and are infrequent in their predictability (eg: hourly observation should be conducted once hourly rather than on the hour every hour).<br> <br>Evidence of recent observation records demonstrated that this was now practice.<br> <br>However, there was a disconnect between the new policy and the pre-printed forms being used to record observations; what staff were being instructed to do and what they were recording.  This was confusing and the evidence produced did not support the expectations of the new policy or demonstrate it had become embedded practice. The evidence produced did not support a change in staff recording quality observations, so that whilst precise and intermittent timings were evidenced, beyond the location of the patient or what they were doing, the actual presentation of the patient was not being recorded.</td>",,,

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.<br><em> </em><br>The <strong>MATTERS OF CONCERN </strong>are as follows. –<br>There was a failure at Hull Royal Infirmary to understand the process of implementing Section 5(2) of the Mental Health act 1983 [MHA] (Doctors Holding Power) as well as general uncertainty about its significance and effect. Mollie absconded from the ward whilst apparently under this section. The paperwork for the implementation of this section of the MHA 1983 was in fact not properly completed and hence invalid. Whilst the Hull &amp; East Yorkshire NHS Trust has taken steps to educate doctors about this power, these were only local measures and I believe that all doctors working in England and Wales should be aware of section 5(2) and nurses of their equivalent power pursuant to section 5(4) of the MHA 1983 and that appropriate awareness and training should be given.</td>",,,
"<td class=""govuk-table__cell""><strong>CORONER’S CONCERNS</strong><br>During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.<br> <br>The <strong>MATTERS OF CONCERN </strong>are as follows:<br>Between his arrival in SACU at 18.37 on 10 July 2020 and his being discovered self suspended with a ligature at 17.45 on 11 July 2020 there, Michael was subject to a 3 man unlock.<br>On the morning of 11 July, a Saturday, there were 3 officers on duty on SACU. This did permit his cell to be unlocked for a meal to be delivered and for a cursory one and a half minute conversation with a nurse that fell short, on her evidence, of an actual medical examination.<br><br>On the afternoon of 11 July there were only one or (briefly) two officers on SACU duty per the staff duty log, albeit, as CCTV footage shows, more officers did attend intermittently for specific tasks. The SACU staff duty log shows only one officer on duty for the whole afternoon to 17.00. In any event medical assessments of Michael were not undertaken at any stage while he was on SACU, the reason being given that he was on three man unlock. It appears that there were never sufficient staff available for a dedicated medical assessment to be undertaken. This notwithstanding that evidence from prison officers and a nurse was that during the course of the afternoon Michale`s presentation had become <em>“</em>angrier<em>” </em>and <em>“</em>bizarre<em>”</em>. In fact, it is now known, he had been ingesting toxic amounts, an unlicensed drug, he had secreted into the prison (his being detected at reception as plugged led him to SACU).         is a highly potent          which effects judgement and lowers inhibitions. The jury subsequently concluded that the absence of medical, and mental health, assessments, and the use of the                           (which was never diagnosed), contributed to the Michael`s death.<br><br>From 17.00, when patrol state commenced, there was clearly only one officer on duty and present. When she discovered Michael self suspended that officer made a perfectly defensible dynamic assessment, electing not to enter the cell unsupported. She made ready to enter for when back up arrived. In the event, partly because there was another discipline incident unfolding on a different wing, this took 2-3 minutes. There were only 16 prison officers available while on patrol state across the entire prison, and they were already at full stretch, and probably beyond it (the Tactical Resources Unit from Doncaster were en route).<br><br>The evidence was that without knowing precisely when Michael self-suspended any such delay could not be held, on a balance of probabilities, to have entered the chain of causation death. However, the fact remains that there was a delay consequent to Michael being on a three man unlock but there being only a single officer available on SACU while in patrol state. It is reasonable to conjecture that this could have made the difference between life and death in this case, and the repetition of these circumstances could well do so in future.<br>In your response dated 15 November 2021 to the Regulation 28 report of HM Assistant Coroner James Thompson of 21 September 2021 following the Inquest into the death of Charlie Brian Todd at HMP Durham, you wrote, amongst other things:<br> <br><em>“</em>There is clear management oversight of the SACU<em>”</em>.<br> <br>This is not what the evidence in the instance case showed. Rather, what it made clear was that:<br> <br>1) the SACU staff log plus CCTV further demonstrated that HMAC Thompson`s point to you that <em>“</em>officers, including officers not posted to SACU, but covering for a shift, were required to allocate various task between themselves on an ad-hoc basis<em>” </em>was an ongoing problem, and this appears to be still ongoing;<br>2)  NOMIS record keeping was unhelpfully sparse (<em>“</em>you would expect more<em>” </em>was the evidence of SACU manager);<br>3)  the daily log was under-utilised as a multi-disciplinary tool, and this appears to be ongoing.<br> <br>You also stated:<br> <br><em>“</em>I am confident that the staffing levels and supervisory arrangements in place are sufficient to deliver all of the SACU`s regime<em>”</em>.<br> <br>This, too, is clearly not the case. Staffing levels remain the same. Safeguarding of prisoners is compromised as a consequence. With a three man unlock imposed, there should be three officers available at all times to ensure safety.

Had [REDACTED] any other officer at base known that Sean’s access had been restricted she would not, I am<br>certain, have allowed him entry.<br><br>There was a serious failure by senior management to effectively and safely manage the South Base Armoury. All the base officers who gave evidence before me told me the armoury system, which they referred to as Chronicle, repeatedly and randomly failed. These multiple failures were, according to [REDACTED] not communicated effectively to her. She agreed that she did not herself make any further detailed enquiry instead relying on her Operational Inspector to manage the issue and/or to feed back as appropriate.<br>The computerised system controlling the access to the armoury at South Base included a number of different parts including the server, the software, the Chronicle system itself, the card readers etc. The system as a whole repeatedly failed. There was no effective ongoing monitoring of the system. CI Rowley Smith agreed that the<br>system did not work properly and the monitoring system did not work properly. As part of a fail safe to ensure that officers who needed weapons could obtain them if the computerised system failed, an armoury override key was kept in a locked box, secured by a PIN, in the equipment room. All officers giving evidence before me agreed that the PIN number was common knowledge.<br><br>The fact that the PIN number was common knowledge meant potentially that any one of the officers working at the base had unfettered access to the armoury [REDACTED]. The fact that the access was not abused by the officers was due wholly to their trustworthiness and professionalism. On this occasion, Sean sought access to the armoury via the key but was thwarted by both PC being present in the equipment room. Unfettered access to the armoury meant that rogue officers (of whom luckily there were none) could potentially have had access to weapons for the purposes of criminality, suicide (as in Sean’s case) or homicide.<br><br>Overall, I find the lax approach to safety and security in the South Base armoury by senior management, who were responsible, to be extraordinary. [REDACTED] agreed that the armoury was an unsafe environment.<br><br>In the interval between Sean’s death and the Inquest some 18 months later, I was not reassured that effective action had been taken to secure the armoury. Immediately post Inquest some reassurance was provided but gaps remained.</td>",,,

"<td class=""govuk-table__cell""><strong>CORONER’S CONCERNS</strong><br>During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.<br><strong> </strong><br>The <strong>MATTERS OF CONCERN </strong>are as follows.<br>1.       The ELFT serious incident (SI) review report identified that, although Mr Largin was discharged to the Woodberry Wetlands neighbourhood rehabilitation team from the crisis (i.e. home treatment) team on 25 January 2022, the neighbourhood team did not allocate him to a team member until 3 February.<br>2.       The report also identified that, despite receiving an email from the Homerton University Hospital community rehabilitation team on 2 February, saying that Mr Largin had been seen on 1 February and was still very depressed, the crisis team failed to reassess him or to re-open his case to the crisis team, but instead referred the community team to the neighbourhood team.<br>3.       However, the SI report did not identify that the crisis team member who made the decision on 2 February simply to advise that Mr Largin should be dealt with by the neighbourhood team failed to record any reasons for her decision.<br>4.       The SI reviewer giving evidence in court said that the SI reviewing team had not even spoken to that crisis team member as part of their investigation, let alone fed back to her.<br>5.      He said they did not at the time realise that she still worked for ELFT, though he accepted that it would have been an extremely straight forward matter to find out. The crisis team member’s manager gave evidence that she thought the relevant decision maker had left the team before Mr Largin’s death, so between 3 and 6 February 2022. When I invited that manager to make a call while the inquest was ongoing to check, she later told me that the team member had not left the crisis team until 29 April 2022.<br>6.    It is believed, I was told, that there was a hot de-brief after Mr Largin’s death. However, no notes were made of that and no entry was made on Mr Largin’s medical record.<br>7.     Thus, nobody from ELFT found out what the decision maker’s thinking had been, or what misconceptions she might have had that other staff members might share. The former crisis team member who made the decision still works for ELFT. As far as I could ascertain, her decision making concerning Mr Largin has never been discussed with her by ELFT managers.<br>8.     The SI review also did not identify that members of the crisis team and the neighbourhood team did not share an understanding of how quickly the neighbourhood team aims to make contact with patients, to assist in their decision making about the correct pathway for a patient. In fact, a member of the neighbourhood team itself gave evidence about the response times that, I was told later, was not correct.<br>9.      Finally, the operations lead for the neighbourhood team had great difficulty in giving me clear evidence about whether his team would or could refer a patient back to the crisis team if they felt the circumstances warranted. He demonstrated a lack of clarity on the point that I found very concerning.</td>",,,
