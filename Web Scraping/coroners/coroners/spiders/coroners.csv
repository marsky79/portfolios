Ref: 2023-0474;Melanie Lee;Barnet Enfield and Haringey Mental Health NHS Trust;During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.I heard evidence that there was no routine mechanism to cross reference what people are prescribed and what medication they are actually collecting, and no automatic notification to GPs who are responsible for the medication prescribing. Zee informed BEH that he had not taken his olanzapine and fluoxetine for two weeks. His GP, who was prescribing that medication, was not informed.I am concerned that GPs are not updated, particularly where patients have expressed suicidal ideation, and may not be aware that people are not taking medication and/or that there may be a risk of stockpiling.;;;;;;;
Ref: 2023-0471;Kate Robertson;Betsi Cadwaladr University Local Health Board;During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: Despite the deceased passing away just shy of 2 years ago, there have been inadequate improvements to manage patients with food intolerances and allergies. The Health Board has been working with other organisations in Wales to create an e-learning module and implement the use of red wrist bands for food intolerances / allergies, but this has taken far too long. The e-learning training module was uploaded to BCUHB system the day prior to the Inquest. It is strongly suspected that this was due to the impending Inquest. The Health Board has not investigated the incident at all. A Medical Examiner Report was prepared following the death in November 2021 highlighting the ingestion of gluten in a coeliac patient. I have raised and continue to raise a number of concerns around the inadequacy of governance and poor investigation processes. There were other incidences of gluten ingestion at Ysbyty Maelor and Deeside Community Hospital. On the at least 4 occasions at Deeside Community Hospital there were no Datix reports completed at the time. I was provided with no evidence that additional training, refresher training or induction training deals with when such reports should be made. I cannot be satisfied and reassured that all staff are aware of when to make a Datix report and how to complete this.;;;;;;;

I heard further evidence from the Interested Persons at a separate hearing on 17th October 2023 in relation to these concerns.†At this hearing I received evidence from both East Suffolk and North Essex NHS Foundation Trust and Northgate High School concerning the measures they had put in place to address the failures identified during the course of the Inquest. I was satisfied that these measures addressed the concerns in relation to each of these Interested Persons and which had arisen from the Inquest.I also received helpful evidence from the East of England Provider Collaborative concerning the measures which that organisation had undertaken in their area of responsibility to address my concern in relation to the availability and allocation of Tier 4 beds in a paediatric mental health facilities to children such as Madeleine.†In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken.

Ref: 2023-0469;James Bennett;Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Foundation Trust | NHS Birmingham and Solihull Integrated Care Board |Department of Health and Social Care;During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. † † The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  Despite recognising Mr Malone needed to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital in June 2023 but there was no bed capacity, BSMHFT RCA report identified no remedial action. The Patient Safety Manager [REDACTED] gave evidence that the lack of psychiatric bed capacity remains an ongoing problem and has not been resolved, and there is a genuine risk of the same problem with another patient in the future.†††††††††††††††††††††† [REDACTED] added there was an exceptional process, which required a considered decision at a high level, to make a bed available through identifying someone currently occupying a bed space to be discharged. In my view, this process is unsatisfactory as it creates a different set of risks around the patient being discharged, and amplifies the chronic shortage of beds. There was reference to two preceding Regulation 28 Reports to Prevent Future Deaths (both available publicly on the judiciary website) that focussed on the chronic lack of mental health resources in Birmingham and Solihull. In relation to the specific issue of a lack of psychiatric bed capacity, in the case of Peter Fleming (no bed was available in August 2022) BSMHFTs response (September 2023) referred to their response in the earlier case of Leroy Hamilton (no bed was available in December 2021). This response (April 2023) stated more resources had been obtained and a collaborative plan had been implemented with NHS Birmingham and Solihull Integrated Care Board.†The issue of adequately funding psychiatric beds is a local and national issue. Locally, BSMHFT require their commissioners to provide the necessary funding.†My principal concern is that the above dates indicate available psychiatric bed capacity in Birmingham and Solihull remains inadequate. Whilst some action may have been taken it is insufficient to resolve the problem. It follows there is a genuine risk of future deaths directly connected to a shortage of psychiatric bed spaces in Birmingham and Solihull unless further action is taken.;;;;;;;
Ref: 2023-0445;Mary Hassell;Depaul UK;During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.†The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.†On 28 March 2023, Igor refused to get out of the shower [REDACTED]. Hostel staff took various actions, including calling the crisis team. The crisis team decided that Igor did not need daily visits, but told staff to call back if there was any change or further concern.†††††† On 14 April 2023, staff found Igor outside, drowsy and incoherent, cold and wet, but did not re-contact the crisis team.†††††† Igor was a vulnerable young man, recently homeless, but the last time that any member of staff had a meaningful conversation with him was on 20 April 2023, ten days before he died.†††††† The Depaul executive director of services recognised at inquest that there should have been more staff conversation with Igor throughout his time at the London Youth Hub.†††††† She also acknowledged that greater attempts should have been made by staff to engage with partner agencies regarding Igors care and welfare.†††††† Igor was only 18 years old and his father did visit him, but the hostel did not have any contact details for his family.†I heard evidence at inquest that Depaul conducted an internal investigation into Igors death. The fact of the report was not disclosed to my office in advance of the inquest as it should have been, and I did not see it until it was mentioned in evidence at the inquest.†However, I have read the report since. It went into some detail and identified that, when Igor was found at 25pm, no staff member had undertaken a welfare check of him since half past midnight, whereas there should have been at least one per shift. I was told at inquest that staff were disciplined about this after Igors death.†At the time of Igors death, there was no national policy on when to increase welfare checks. I was told that there is now national guidance.†The Depaul investigation also identified that staff at the London Youth Hub had not attended self harm and suicide awareness training. I heard that training has now increased and is mandatory.†The report described the culture at the London Youth Hub as chaotic.;;;;;;;
Ref: 2023-0441;Laura Bradford;Langford Centre | NHS England;During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.†The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:(brief summary of matters of concern)†Initial referral  there seems to be a gap at the initial referral and admission stage in obtaining information about and recording previous methods of self-harm and suicide. There also appears to be a gap in the seeking and recording of relevant information from an individuals family at the point of referral and admission. An individuals family is often able to provide detailed and useful information about events that may not have been previously reported and/or be able to bridge the gap in communications between various health agencies involved in someones care.†Access to notes  the other concerning issue is the difficulty prevalent within the private sector in the accessing of NHS notes. It appears to be the position across the private sector that access to an individuals notes is not provided as standard. This means that there may be a significant gap in the information available when someone is admitted to a premises run by a private healthcare provider, even within an NHS allocated bed. This gap in information can have an impact on an individuals risk assessment and their subsequent care plan.;;;;;;;
Ref: 2023-0461;Robert Simpson;HM Prison and Probation Service;During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.†The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:(brief summary of matters of concern)†ACCT documentsIn evidence at the inquest ACCT assessors and case managers accepted that they had not complied with various mandatory actions required under PSI 64/2011: Managing Prisoner Safety in Custody. They were not able to identify in evidence the risk factors it was mandatory to consider for persons at risk of suicide or self-harm. They had not recorded triggers in the relevant section of the ACCT nor recorded all risk factors in the Caremap section. One ACCT case manager stated that they did not know whether it was necessary to record a trigger if action had been taken to mitigate it. They also stated they categorised risk based on òremaining risk after action had been taken despite having not recorded the trigger.†This leads me to have 2 concerns:The first regards the provision and quality of ACCT training and refresher training given this evidence was given some 2 years after the death of Mr Huntley and well after the disruptions brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic.†I also heard evidence that despite an ACCT being a òwhole prison document (which can and should be opened by any member of staff) training was not mandatory for non-security staff.In 2019 there was no joint training for prison and heathcare staff on the use of ACCT documents. I am informed by CNWL that under ACCT v6 (which has been in force since July 2021) joint training is provided for and this is reassuring. However I understand that the frequency of this training is determined in relation to operational capacity at individual establishment level. This is of concern given the evidence from witnesses at this inquest some 20 months after this version came into force.†The second relates to the quality and effectiveness of ACCT audits. We heard evidence that ACCT documents are reviewed annually. The case manager mentioned above advised that he had not received any adverse feedback about the quality of his ACCT documents and no issues with them had been identified. Given the inadequate nature of the ACCT document opened on Mr Huntley and apparent lack of understanding about completing the documents the quality of the audits is brought into question.†Information sharing.In evidence it was clear that the ACCT document was the only written document used for sharing information between the healthcare staff employed by the NHS trust and the prison security staff. Healthcare staff record and share their information within SystemOne which the prison security staff do not have access to. Prison security staff record information within NOMIS which healthcare staff do not have access to.†Evidence from witnesses revealed that these information systems are not necessarily fully reviewed for relevant information prior to attending ACCT meetings.†In addition a decision relating to Mr Huntleys care (i.e. the move to a different cell) was taken by healthcare staff at their own meeting when they did not have the benefit of information available to prison staff.†[REDACTED] of HMP Winchester informed me that a Safety Intervention Meeting was now carried out weekly, chaired by a Senior Governor and attended by representatives of the prison, physical and mental health care providers and the probation service. This meeting covers each person subject to an ACCT and any relevant information is share via the ACCT case manager, NOMIS and the multi disciplinary team.†[REDACTED] could not assist me with whether this was a HMP Winchester initiative or had a wide application across the prison estate.†My concern is therefore that the current procedures and policies for sharing information are incomplete or not fully complied with. This renders the information on which separate teams make decisions about a prisoner incomplete and increases the risk that important factors are not considered.†CellsAt HMP Winchester within the area, considered and referred to by most healthcare and prison staff, as the òmental health cells there are 2 cells which are not equipped in a way to reduce the amount of available ligature points.†It was clear from the evidence of the healthcare staff at the MDT meeting on the 28/05/2020 that they did not consider the contents of the cell when deciding to move Mr Huntley to the òmental health cells simply due to the fact he was on an ACCT. I heard evidence that the policy of CNWL has now changed and that a cell move risk assessment must now be carried out and that there is now a revised ligature audit process. HMP Winchester informed me that there is now an annual ligature audit carried out in conjunction with the new healthcare provider at that establishment. In addition I was informed that all telephone points in the òmental health cells at HMP Winchester have now been removed and placed outside the cells. These are welcome developments.†However at inquest those representing the HMPPS could not inform me whether all telephone points within cells designed for use by those at risk of self harm across the prison estate had been removed. Nor was any evidence available as to what consideration had been given to reducing the risk of the telephone points by design of the points themselves or the manner of their installation. Those representing were invited to provide this information after the hearing but have not done so.†I am concerned that telephone points which provide a ligature point may remain within cells which prison and health care staff consider to be suitable for use by those at risk of self harm.†The final area of concern is the lack of certified Safer Cells at HMP Winchester. The inquest heard evidence that these had either never existed at HMP Winchester or had not done so for many years. The evidence from prison governors was that, generally speaking within the prison estate, they were not used or proved too hard to maintain to the certified standard. However certified Safer Cells are still referred to in PSI 64/2011 as a means of managing risk from ligatures. It was heard in evidence that HMP Winchester experience high levels of self-harm and suicide and yet it did not appear that consideration had been given recently to introducing these. Those representing the HMPSS at the were invited to provide information about the status and use of safer certified cells across the prison estate. No such information has been forthcoming.;;;;;;;

In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: The notes made by the SPoE Nurse for use during discussion at the screening MDT meeting did not include any reference to the report of a recent suicide attempt and the Court was not satisfied that the risk of suicide had been identified or recognised by the SPoE Nurse† The Court heard that the practice at the screening MDT meeting was for the SPoE Nurse to read out the contents of the referral to the Psychiatrist who would then advise on next steps. There was no evidence to show that any form of meaningful multi-team discussion took place at the screening MDT meeting† There was no direct contact between the mental health team and the Deceased (either by telephone or in person) before the decision to reject the referral was made† The Consultant Psychiatrist present at the MDT meeting has no recollection of discussing the referral and whilst the evidence was that a letter to the GP practice explaining the reason for rejecting the referral was generated there is no record of this letter on the Trusts electronic systems or having been received by the GP practice The evidence was that there is no member of staff allocated to deal with referrals when the SPoE Nurse is absent from work which means that during their absence, urgent referrals are not being reviewed.† There is currently no Standard Operating Procedure on how referrals into the SPoE Older Adults should be managed† There is currently no system by which the management of referrals into the SPoE and related decision-making are audited.

Ref: 2023-0439;Lorraine Harris;Human Resources;During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. (1) During evidence the matter of monitoring people who attend the bridge in mental health distress was raised. There is a minimum of 2 staff in the control room and 3 staff covering útraffic dutiesù on the ground. The security staff at the bridge deal with a variety of security issues however this report only seeks to address their role in relation to those suffering from mental health distress. The staff are expected to identify and monitor any person of concern entering the walkways of the bridge.This involves looking at their actions, mannerisms, behaviour and body language. Staff are expected to identify those who may require assistance and contact staffing colleagues to approach them.It appeared there was no structured training policy in place to ensure that staff are given appropriate training to deal with identifying vulnerable people. On joining, staff have an 8 weeks mentoring course, whereby an experienced colleague shows them the role and advises on what to look for. Staff may also undertake an on line suicide prevention course and mental health first aid at work as well as safety harness/working at height training. However there appeared to be no structure to any of the training for this vital role and of more concern there was no input from a trained medical professional with significant knowledge of working with those suffering from mental health crisis. Nor was there any current input with regard to how to talk and negotiate with people in crisis. I was informed that there were many very competent staff who had good intuition, but I have concerns that without appropriate and structured input from a health care professional, any experience on the job is based on unstable foundations. It was evident that the role is vitally important in identifying those at risk and seeking the appropriate help. Without receiving knowledge from someone trained in mental health, having a substantive input on negotiation and how to interact with those in crisis then the difficult job of assessing people and reacting appropriately with them becomes very difficult.(2)†While the úRight Care/Right Personù process appears to ensure that the correct emergency service should respond if called, delays in response means often staff are left dealing with a vulnerable person for many hours due to unavailability of emergency services or mental health support.(3) I am aware that there is a [REDACTED] Suicide Prevention Meeting where a multi-agency approach can be taken to address the reduction of suicide [REDACTED]. †I consider that this may be the correct forum to recognise the unique role the staff play and implement a structured training plan with all agencies input for any person beginning work in that role.(4)† I was informed in evidence that a vulnerable person is escorted off the bridge everyday  this shows the extent of the problem and the staff to be provided with the very best training available. I echo the views of Lizzies family when talking about the role that the Security Staff have úthere is so much responsibility on someones head, for them to decide whether someone is likely to jump or notù. I feel that these people should be given a specific set training plan to help them do what is a vital and important role.;;;;;;;

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. † The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. The inquest heard evidence of the distress caused to Holly and the impact on her health by the long waits to be seen by gastroenterologists and gynaecologists within the NHS. The evidence heard was that post- Covid, the waiting times to be seen in both specialities unless the referral was on the two-week cancer wait had grown significantly across England. As an illustration the inquest was told that pre-Covid, the average wait for a routine gynaecology referral was 18 weeks. Now in England the wait was often in excess of 12 months. Even an urgent referral would often involve a wait of over 40 weeks. This was leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment even in those with significant/severe health conditions.;;;;;;;

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.†(1)††The serious incident investigation by the Trust has been substantially delayed. Sarah died on the 10th of July 2022 and the Trust confirmed to the Coroners service that there was to be a serious incident investigation on the 26th July 202 The serious incident investigation remained unallocated and with no timeframe for completion for over 7 months and on the 13th of March 2023 as this remained the position I listed this case for Inquest on the 24th of April 202 On the 17th April 2023 I was alerted by deceaseds family to possible progress in respect of the serious incident investigation in this case, subsequent to their formal complaint to the Trust. After making enquiries of the Trust I was informed that the report would be available at the end of May 2023 and I therefore acceded to a family request to adjourn the final hearing given the short delay this would cause. On the 25th of April 2023 the Coronial service was informed that in fact that it was unlikely that the report would be finalised by May and would be likely end of July/August time. On the 26th of June I was informed that the report would now not be available until the òend of September/beginning of October and that the initial dates given were útoo ambitiousù. The case was listed to commence on the 16th of November 2023 on that basis. On the 28th of July the deceaseds family notified me of a likely further delay in the report being available due to the authors sick leave from work. The Trust offered reassurance that the report remained due òend of September/beginning of October. On the 28th of September a Pre Inquest Review Hearing was held in relation to a separate discrete issue and I was informed that the report was to be further delayed and would not be available until the end of October.†(2)† The NHS framework sets out clearly a timescale of 60 working days for the completion of investigation reports and highlights the importance of working in an open, honest and transparent way. One of the key underpinning principles in the management of all serious incidents is that they should be timely and responsive. The purpose of the investigation is to ensure that weaknesses in a system or process are identified to understand what went wrong, how it went wrong and what can be done to prevent similar incidents occurring again.†(3)††If the final version report is received by the end of October it will be some 15 months since Sarahs death and some 13 months outside the NHS framework. This is neither timely nor responsive.†(4)††I have previously issued a PFD report in relation to this issue as has the Senior Coroner for Durham and Darlington, Mr Chipperfield, who stated that Tees Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust routinely fails, to employ, in a timely way, nationally recognised process and procedure designed to prevent avoidable death. In permitting delay of úserious incidentù investigations, TEWV may: (i) permit lethal hazard to persist for longer than necessary;;;;;;;

Ref: 2023-0361;Jenny Goldring;HMP Belmarsh | Practice Plus Group | Home Office | HM Prison and Probation Service | Ministry of Justice;During the Inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. A number of these have been addressed and do not require a PFD report.†I have also considered a report by HM Chief Inspector of Prisons, úThe experience of immigration detainees in prisons,ù dated September 202 Some of the key concerns in that report mirror concerns I came to independently having heard the evidence in this Inquest. Published responses to the report suggest some concerns are being addressed, albeit it is not clear if they have been resolved.†In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:††††† Although the specific issues below were not left to the jury as úcausative mattersù in this Inquest, I am concerned about the potential impact of these issues in other cases.Timing of IS91 notification.††††† The timing of the notification to Mr Santos by the SSHD that he was not to be released at the end of his custodial sentence but was to be held on immigration detention pending a decision on deportation. The SSHD target for notification is 30 days prior to release. In this case it was 8 days late. I heard PFD evidence that this 30-day target is not met in 40% of cases and that 83% of cases are notified within 7 days of the end of the sentence. I am concerned at the potential uncertainty and distress caused to Foreign National Offenders (úFNOsù) by notification at this stage.Signposting legal advice about immigration matters.††††† Mr Santos signed a form on 24 October 2020 to receive support from a charity supporting immigration detainees. Bail forms were sent to them by the prison on 29 October 2020.††††† I am concerned as to how access to legal advice is facilitated and signposted.††††† In PFD evidence, I was informed that FNOs (in a similar position to Mr Santos) are now entitled to 30 minutes of free legal advice following a High Court decision in February 202 In HMP Belmarsh, this entitlement is displayed on a notice in each Houseblock. I am concerned that displaying a notice is insufficient to draw this entitlement to the attention of FNOs. I do not know if this is a wider issue in other prisons. Understanding of immigration status, including appeal and bail procedures and is complex. Access to legal advice is vital to prevent confusion.Communication between agencies.††††† Communication issues between the agencies dealing with immigration and sentence planning may lead to confusion and uncertainty for FNOs.††††† I appreciate that any legal advice to FNOs should be from a legal adviser. I am encouraged that the probation service (who employ community offender managers) is seeking to develop a cohort of probation officers specialising in FNOs and immigration. There are now 201 SPOCs across 12 regions and a hub lead developing this model and leading engagement with the SSHD. There is no such model in the prison in respect of úprison offender managersù who also liaise with the SSHD about FNOs.†Delays by SSHD and Probation and failure to obtain information.††††† I am concerned at the potential impact of delays/failure to obtain information in other cases. In Mr Santos case there were delays by probation in allocating a community offender manager and providing an up-to-date OASYS report. There were also delays by the SSHD progressing Mr Santos case, including issue of the Stage 2 letter, failure to obtain medical records and delay in requesting the OASYS report.††††† I am encouraged that there is now a centralised system (and form) for the SSHD to request OASYS reports from probation although it is not clear the extent to which requests are going through this system. Consent to obtain medical information is sought from FNOs at an induction meeting by Immigration Prison Teams (úIPTsù). Further IPT officers attend prisons and play a key role in obtaining this type of information. However it is not clear what systems are in place to facilitate the obtaining of medical information.The SSHD Internal report0.††† The SSHD disclosed an Internal report into Mr Santos case midway through the Inquest, which was not on his Home Office file. The lawyers representing the SSHD were unaware of this report. The head of FNO Returns Command only became aware of it the preceding week and understood it had been disclosed.1††† The report detailed delays and issues in Mr Santos case and the SSHD then made formal admissions of the relevant (non-causative) failures which were recorded by the jury in the Record of Inquest at my direction.1††† This report was dated February 2021 and listed action points for the relevant department. Although I am told that these are now being addressed, I am concerned that important learning points (which could prevent future deaths) were not disseminated and actioned as they should have been.Opening cell doors at night1††† In evidence there was a continued misunderstanding that the policy did not apply to Operational Support Grade (OSG) officers and it was understood that they should never open cell doors at night. This was despite the PPO report dated December 2021 (at paragraph 73) requesting this be addresses 1††† The prison stated in PFD evidence that all staff will be instructed as to the policy in terms of opening cell doors at night (which requires a dynamic risk assessment).1††† I remain concerned that this appears to be a longstanding belief held by experienced officers.;;;;;;;
Ref: 2023-0362;Anton van Dellen;Home Office | National Police Chiefs Council | NHS England;During the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. †††††† The use of Custodial Nurse Practitioners (CNPs) in Police custody instead of doctors. The 2003 Home Office circular appeared to envisage nurses working alongside doctors, when this is not how they are deployed. CNPs are also seeing high risk and complex patients without adequate training in mental health. The deployment in Police custody of CNPs places detained persons at risk of death in the future. The 2003 Home Office circular also does not recognise the risk of suicide and self-harm as being a core competency.†††††† The training of agency staff in the ACCT process and recognising the appropriate threshold to open an ACCT. The training of agency staff in ACCT does not appear to be part of the commissioning process by NHS England and individual providers do not appear to provide training to agency staff in the ACCT process. This places residents in prison at risk of death, given the high level of usage of agency healthcare staff in prison.;;;;;;;

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. †The Inquest identified multiple failings in the care provided to Allison. The failings occurred within a children and adolescent mental health service which was significantly under resourced.†The Inquest heard evidence that the under resourcing of CAMHS services is not confined to this local Trust but is a matter of National concern.†The under resourcing of CAMHS services contributed to delays in Allison being assessed by the mental health team. The delay between triage to assessment was 9 months. The Inquest heard evidence that this delay is not unusual within CAMHS teams across the country.†There was very little evidence of any consultant psychiatrist leadership within the CAMHS team. The Inquest heard of the difficulties in recruiting suitably qualified psychiatrists to CAMHS teams.†The Inquest heard that funding for CAMHS teams within the allocation of funding for general mental health is poor.†The Inquest heard that the number of children presenting to CAMHS teams is increasing significantly. The number of referrals of children to the local CAMHS team in the early 2010s was between 10  12 per week.† The current number of referrals is in the region of 140 patients per week.†There is a concern that ongoing under resourcing of CAMHS services (whilst demand continues to increase), will result in future similar deaths.;;;;;;;
Ref: 2023-0314;Adam Smith;College of Policing and Metropolitan Police;During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.I received evidence, in particular from the investigating officer (OIC), who dealt with the investigation into the allegation against Mr Leger, and from an investigator from the Metropolitan Polices Directorate of Professional Standards (DPS), who conducted an investigation on behalf of the IOPC into the way in which the criminal investigation was undertaken, in particular the consideration of Mr Legers welfare and support offered tohim.†I heard evidence:†∑†††††† That when a person who has been RUId is charged, standard practice (in accordance with current Metropolitan Police policies and procedures) is for that charge to be communicated to them via a PCR with no advance warning.†∑†††††† That this is the case regardless of the offence, or seriousness of the offence, with which they are being charged.†∑†††††† That in exceptional circumstances, where an individual is considered to be in a high-risk category, arrangements can be made for the PCR to be delivered in person and/or for a third party to be present to provide support.†∑†††††† That it is recognised that certain types of allegation, such as a sexual allegation (as was the case here), may carry a higher risk. This, of itself, does not place an individual into a high-risk category for the purposes of delivering the news that they are to be charged (by way of a PCR).†∑†††††† That whether an individual is, exceptionally, considered to be in a high-risk category (such as to cause a PCR to be delivered in person) is reliant on information about their mental health coming to the attention of the OIC. There is no formal requirement for the OIC proactively to seek this information.†∑†††††† That there is no formal process for assessing an individuals mental health and/or risk of suicide or self-harm at the time of delivery of a PCR.†It is important to note the following:†∑†††††† At the point of charge, nothing has been proven against the individual concerned. They face an allegation, and are innocent if and until proven guilty to the criminal standard.†∑†††††† Many people are RUId. As such, PCR is now routinely used to bring most criminal charges.†∑†††††† Individuals who have been RUId can remain with this status for long periods of time (months or years) before a decision is made whether or not to charge them.†∑†††††† Whilst there are formal procedures to assess an individuals mental health and risk of self-harm or suicide when they attend apolice station for interview, once they have left the police station there are no such formal procedures (as above), notwithstanding the potential for a substantial period to elapse between the time they last attended a police station and the time that they are charged.†∑†††††† Being charged with any criminal offence, especially one which carries the potential for a custodial sentence, can, self-evidently, have a significant deleterious effect on an individuals mental health.†It appears to me that, in the absence of a formal mechanism to assess, at the time of being charged, an individuals mental health and risk of suicide or self-harm, there is an obvious risk of individuals in the future taking their own lives as a result of being charged by way of a PCR (potentially following a lengthy period of having been RUId and potentially months or years since there was last any consideration by the police of their mental health and risk of suicide or self-harm).†In Mr Legers case, the relevant policies and procedures were those of the Metropolitan Police. However, these issues clearly arise at a wider (national) level and, as head of the College of Policing, you have overall responsibility for policies/guidance disseminated at a national level.;;;;;;;
Ref: 2023-0340;Crispin Butler;Prison and Probation Service;During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.†The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:(brief summary of matters of concern)†HMP Aylesbury transitioned from a High Security Young Offenders Institution (a role it had undertaken for many years) into a Category C Training Prison after the time in which Haik Nikolyan had been an inmate. This has led to a quite different cohort of prisoners with different and additional issues to be addressed in their management and healthcare needs.†Staffing changes have also occurred over the period, although the physical prison infrastructure is largely the same with some wing refurbishments being undertaken from time to time.†Healthcare provision is also being undertaken by different providers today.†Following the conclusion in March this year of an Inquest into the death of another young prisoner, Anthony McNally, at Aylesbury (which occurred in January 2021), a letter was written by me to the Governor in which I noted, inter alia, that the evolution to Category C status required time and resources and was not without significant challenges going forward.†I was then (as now) interested to hear that appropriate resources continued to be sought and deployed by the prison to continue the work, from prison and healthcare perspectives, adapting to the Category C status, ensuring the safety and wellbeing of prisoners, staff and those with cause to visit the prison going forward.†Some three months further on, my concerns are heightened to the extent that a death may result in a variety of circumstances through the continuing significant issues HMP Aylesbury is encountering in recruitment and retention of experienced prison staff, particularly Grade 3 officers.†Although initial steps are being taken towards implementation of a new neurodiversity plan, including the management of prisoners with autistic traits (pertinent to the circumstances of the death of Haik Nikolyan in 2019) and some recruitment has just taken place, without appropriate resources specifically in this area and within the broader staff cohort, there will be difficulties in maintaining this important work.†The evidence heard at this Inquest in July 2023 indicates that general staffing levels are likely to impact upon the operation of the daily regime, training and reaction to individual incidents, against a background of increasing levels of violence and access to illicit substances, resulting from the changing cohort of longer-term and older prisoners within this Category C institution.†The indication in evidence was that addressing these issues and continuing to address these issues is a matter for His Majestys Prisons and Probation Service, working with HMP Aylesbury.;;;;;;;

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:-
(1)   No assessment of the risk of suicide or self-harm upon release took place during the Deceasedís time in detention
 
(2)   There was a lack of clear communication to the Police as to what, if any assessment had taken place.

(3)   The conversation between the Practitioner and the Deceased took place through an observation hatch in circumstances where no risk was posed to the Practitioner from being in the same room as the Deceased. This was not best practice.
 
(4)   The terminology used by the Practitioner was misleading in that it suggested that there was no role for the Liaison and Diversion service because no unmet needs or vulnerabilities had been identified. The evidence was that the Deceased had declined consent for an assessment of unmet needs and vulnerabilities and therefore the notes should have made clear that an assessment of unmet needs and vulnerabilities had not taken place.
 
(5)   The ëreviewí undertaken by a Health & Justice Operational Manager of the West Mercia Health & Justice Service consisted of duplication of the Practitioners statement with no comment, observations or identification of areas of learning.";;;;;;;

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. (1)† It was evident that the lack of consistency in staff dealing with Mr Donoghues care was a factor in his ability to engage and be honest with those having oversight of him at a very fragile time in his treatment.(2)† Evidence was heard that the HBTT system is a nationwide treatment as an alternative to hospital admission and although peoples care in HBTT had improved, a real continuity of staff could only occur with a substantive change which would include additional funding, recruitment of appropriate staff and an ability to retain staff. I was informed that if these issues were addressed it would allow more capacity to manage consistency alongside the other demands of the service.(3)† It is worthy of note that this is the 2nd inquest heard within 3 weeks in this jurisdiction whereby inconsistency of care staff has been cited as an issue in a suicide. The other inquest was the death of a 20 year old woman.(4) Mental Health is a rising problem and it is my understanding that 115 people die by suicide every week. Acknowledgement of the important work undertaken by HBTT and the need to give the very best support to those who have taken the, often difficult, step of seeking help with their care is a matter that requires imminent attention.;;;;;;;

Ref: 2023-0283;R Mahmood;City of Bradford Metropolitan District Council;During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. † The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) † A detailed review of the evidence in this case, which included evidence from two Schools ([REDACTED]), as well as from Bradford Childrens Social Services, the TRACKS Education team (at Bradford Council), the SCIL Team and the Councils SEND Team, revealed that no one person or department at Bradford Council had an overview of Councils involvement in relation to Leah (prior to her death).†Of greater concern was that that remained so after each of the Council departments involved were notified that Leah had passed away.†Every organisation which had contact with the Coroners service in relation to Leahs death, with the exception of Bradford Council, was able to provide the Court with an overview/analysis of their involvement with Leah prior to her death and (where appropriate) the lessons they had learnt as a result their involvement with Leah.†The Police and the local Mental Health Trust were examples of two public bodies who had and were able to provide an overview/analysis to the Court in terms of their involvement with Leah and confirm whether there were any lessons to be learned by them.†The evidence provided by witnesses from the various Bradford Council teams which were involved with Leah, showed a clear disconnect in the involvement of the various Council departments. That was not caused by those individuals who had provided written statements to the Court or the two who attended to provide oral evidence.†Whilst the Inquest hearing did not identify actions/omissions on the part of individuals/teams within the Council which more than minimally, negligibly or trivially contributed to Leahs death, the concern is that Bradford Council appeared not to have a system/process in place which allowed anyone (whether an individual / a team) within the Council to have an overview of deaths where there had been previous Council involvement with the deceased (in this case a child).†In the apparent absence of such oversight Bradford Council would not be able to learn lessons from such cases (or even know if there were lessons to be learned). The absence of such a single point of oversight as was apparent in Leahs case, contributes to the risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken.;;;;;;;
Ref: 2023-0244;James Bennett;Department of Health and Social Care, NHS England, NHS Digital, Birmingham and Solihull Integrated Care Board, Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health NHS Trust and Birmingham City Council;During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. † † The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:††††††† There continues to be a chronic lack of resources to treat seriously mentally ill patients in Birmingham and Solihull. In the summer of 2022 Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Trust (òBSMHFT) wanted to admit the deceased to an inpatient psychiatric unit, however, no bed was available, and he remained in the community. Shortly before his death, the deceased had been detained by the police under section 136 of the mental health act. There was no available òplace of safety and he had to be taken to an emergency department. The police, BSMHFT, and hospital Drs agreed the deceased needed to be assessed under the mental health act, however Birmingham City Council could not provide an approved mental health practitioner (òAMPH) to attend in a 24-hour period. When the section 136 lapsed the deceased was discharged home after a review by a mental health nurse. At the time of his death the deceased was on BSMHFTs waiting list for a care- coordinator. The lack of care-coordinators, mental health inpatient beds, òplace of safety, and AMHPs, presents a risk seriously mentally ill people are not receiving necessary treatment. The evidence is that these issues are a consequence of a chronic lack of resources at a local and national level. The Birmingham and Solihull coroners have been repeating identical concerns in Prevention of Future Death Reports for many years.†††††† BSMHFT utilizes self-contained specialist teams. The deceased was treated by (a) crisis team/home treatment team, (b) community mental health team, and (b) psychiatric liaison team. The evidence demonstrated communication between the specialist teams was not effective and this caused delays. For example, the psychiatric liaison team nurse that reviewed the deceased updated the community mental health team. However, the GP could not prescribe the deceaseds medication in October 2022 because it had not been approved by the community mental health team consultant via an ESCA and the deceased went without his medication. The deceaseds GP had to contact the community mental health team directly notwithstanding the psychiatric liaison nurses involvement. The deceased cited this delay as making his mental health worse shortly before his death. My concern is communication between the specialist teams is not effective enough. BSMHFTs RCA action plan is to seek assurance from the CCG/ICB that communication between the specialist teams is being strengthened. My concern is that this does not go far enough and there should be consideration of a formal process or policy.†††††† Carbamazepine management was proposed in 2012 to manage the deceaseds mental health however this was not picked up by his GP and was only noted by a BSMHFT consultant in August 202 Therefore, the deceased went 10 years without this medication. BSMHFT could not explain at the inquest why this omission had not been identified sooner. BSMHFTs RCA action plan does not have any action to avoid a repeat occurrence. My concern is this issue indicates a problem with process and systems and further consideration is required to avoid a repeat occurrence.†††††† The deceaseds GP raised concerns that different health organisations use different digital systems that do not communicate with each other. Further, GPs often do not get important patient updates from primary care organisations for many days or weeks. (See examples above: the GP did not pick up the carbamazepine prescription, and could not prescribe the medication in October 2022). My concern is communication between different health organisations is not as effective as it could be and important information is being missed, and consequently a material delay in treatment is occurring.†††††† The deceaseds GP raised concerns that current resources do not allow GPs to pro- actively check patients are collecting prescribed medication due to excessive patient lists. My concern is that this is a consequence of lack of resources at a national level.†In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is† my statutory duty to report to you.†The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:(brief summary of matters of concern)†Preamble†During the course of the inquest, evidence was heard about Mr. Ashtons gambling activities, both prior to and, in greater detail, after July 201 The evidence showed that Mr. Ashton had, at times, used a number of ways to protect himself from the potential of excessive losses from, and excessive deposits into, his online account, in order to gamble. Those methods included self-exclusion, temporary or permanent, from certain products and/or activities and placing limits on the value of his deposits and/or losses, during a specific, pre-determined period of time.†During the òrelevant period examined closely during the investigation and inquest, between July 2019 and the date of Mr. Ashtons death on 22 April 2021, although Mr. Ashton utilised a number of what are known as òplayer protection tools, as outlined above, the operator he was gambling with during the relevant period, Betfair, did not take any measures, save for sending a number of e-mails to Mr. Ashton, to tell him about the existence of a number of protection tools that players could potentially access. During the relevant period, the evidence showed that Mr. Ashton was a problem gambler and, in the last 10-12 weeks of his life, his problem gambling became more acute, intrusive and, on balance, distressing to him.†Concerns1)††† I remain concerned that the player protection tools, as mentioned above, were and are inadequate to protect a person such as Mr. Ashton, who was a problem gambler with a worsening problem, specifically that such tools do not amount to any or any meaningful interaction with the gambler, or any intervention into the practices of the gambler.†2)†††† I remain concerned that the algorithm devised and operated by Betfair, to assist its staff in, amongst other things, observing and monitoring the gambling patterns and practices of its customers, failed to flag up Mr. Ashton as a problem gambler, despite the increases in his time online (gambling) the value of his deposits and the size of his losses, in part because his gambling practices, even in the last 10-12 weeks of his life, were deemed not to be exceptional, when averaged among gambling customers, generally.†3)†††† I remain concerned that, as was apparent through the evidence of a senior employee witness during the course of the inquest, the operator Betfair appears to judge the extent of its responsibilities to gambling customers solely with regard to industry (regulatory) standards, rather than current good or best practice in order to prevent further harming problem gamblers, or those who, as a result of their changing practices and patterns are likely to become problem gamblers.;;;;;;;

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:Pre-ambleThe inquest heard evidence that Miss Zarins had suffered with depression since 200 She managed this by taking anti-depressant medication intermittently, she stopped taking her anti-depressants in June/July 202Miss Zarins came under the care of Leicestershire Partnership NHS Trust (úLPTù) on 22 November 2021, after taking an intentional overdose the day before. Miss Zarins was initially under the care of LPTs Mental Health Liaison team but was transferred to the care of LPTs CRISIS Team when she returned to her home address on 22 November 202 Miss Zarins expressed a desire to work with the CRISIS team and to recommence anti-depressants as soon as possible in order to improve her mental health.On 23 November 2021 Miss Zarins was discussed at a Multi-Disciplinary Team (úMDTù) meeting at LPT. The discussions at that meeting were fundamentally flawed, as was the plan for Miss Zarins care moving forward that was formed at that meeting and then implemented. The meeting proceeded on the basis that Miss Zarins was on, and had been on, anti-depressant medication at the time of taking the overdose, this was incorrect.The second and final MDT meeting where Miss Zarins was discussed (on 24 November 2021) also proceeded on this same mistaken basis.Despite Miss Zarins verbalising both her desire to get more sleep and her desire to go back onto anti-depressants as soon as possible, neither sleeping tablets nor anti-depressants were prescribed to her by LPT before she died. LPT continued to advise Miss Zarins that she would have to wait until 30 November 2021 to have a medical review.A member of LPT staff who was present at both MDT meetings informed the inquest that he did not have time to read the notes of the patients that were to be discussed at the MDT meetings. The staff member had not read Miss Zarins core assessment documentation (which correctly stated she was not on any anti-depressants) before either MDT meeting.Evidence heard at inquest was that Miss Zarins should have been put back onto anti- depressants and prescribed sleeping tablets on 23 November 202LPT undertook a Serious Incident Investigation into the care provided to Miss Zarins before her death. The investigation was wholly inadequate. Issues include, but are not limited to:  There was no medical input into the investigation;;;;;;;

Ref: 2023-0231;Fiona Wilcox;West London NHS Trust;Matters of Concern.†The generic, tick-box style of history recording by CATT which does not paint a†full and proper picture of the mental health of the patient, especially compared to the assessments of psychiatric liaison, are such that risk may be unrecorded and under appreciated by CATT and patients thus be put at risk. That the role of CATT to look for alternatives to admission may risk CATT†discharging patients who would benefit from admission and risk the repeat of making treatment plans that had recently failed such as in this case. Rather than looking for admission alternatives being a core function, should CATT rather better be focussed on the best treatment plan for the individual patient and thus admission being viewed as a clear option where appropriate rather a last resort, as it often appears to be presented in such cases before the coroner?. That the provision of care-coordinators be increased and improved so that†patients who require them have ready access at the time of need and are not placed on a waiting list. That patients to be discharged by CATT, as well as patients to be admitted are†discussed with the on-call psychiatrist so that plans may be reviewed, and thus the risk of not admitting patients who would benefit from and/ or require admission such as Mr Khala, are less likely to be discharged inappropriately. That where psychiatric teams differ in their assessments such as CATT and†psychiatric liaison, as occurred here, patients are not discharged until opinion is sort from the on-call consultant and re-discussion taken place between those with differing views.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.The Trust has conducted a PSIR the contents of which were reviewed at inquest. The report reached conclusions I found entirely reasonable. I also heard from†[REDACTED] about the steps that are being taken to implement the changes felt to be appropriate. This includes a change to the consultant model with one consultant now responsible for the individual wards. There is also an initiative to standardise documentation, for example, at handover, and later MDT (when risks are reviewed), to ensure this is incorporated into RiO, together with an express intention to involve the family in decision-making. It was accepted that risk should be assessed by a nurse prior to granting leave to an informal patient particularly where unescorted leave is being considered for the first time.Although Chriss death occurred in February 2022, it also became clear that the process had not been completed. It was hoped this could be achieved by the end of July this year but the inquest was told there would need to be consideration of the proposals by the different consultants now involved. I was concerned to ensure that the process was completed without undue delay and it is with this in mind that I now write to you.;;;;;;;

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. †††† The inquest heard evidence that the backlogs for therapy were such that the waiting list at the time she was assessed as being appropriate for step 4 therapy had a two year wait time. Since that time the waiting period had not decreased and was now between 2 -3 years in both primary and secondary care. This was due to a shortage of trained therapists and demands on the service and was a national issue not specific to the CWP trust.†††† The inquest was told that the trust had since Michelles death recognised that the lack of ownership created through the application of its referral and discharge policy internally carried an unacceptable risk. Significant changes had been made. However it was unclear if nationally the lesson had been shared and that other mental health trusts had taken similar steps.†††† The evidence before the inquest was that there needed to be a clear understanding by all prosecuting authorities of the impact of a prosecution on someone with a complex mental health background such as Michelle. In Michelles case the BTP file reviewer (the nature of the offence Michelle faced meant that it was not a CPS lawyer who made the charging decision) had not correctly applied the public interest test and had not considered the mental health/vulnerability of Michelle Jennings as required to. As a consequence a decision was taken to prosecute her without an assessment of the impact on Michelle and her case was dealt with by the Magistrates Court without them being given the full background in relation to her deteriorating mental health. BTP are as a consequence of Michelles death taking steps to address how their prosecution teams should deal with the public interest test and gather information where mental health is an issue. However there is no clear mechanism for such learning and changes (to reduce the risk to life) in relation to vulnerable people such as Michelle to be implemented within the other 42 Police Forces in England and Wales or within other agencies responsible for prosecuting criminal offences.;;;;;;;

Evidence from Wokingham Borough Council was that they were not at that time aware of the number of safeguarding referrals that had been made.†A decision was made (some six days before the inquest) that a SAR will now be conducted.

The nurse felt that Mr. Harper would benefit from a period of treatment under the care of the Home Treatment Team, and because Mr. Harper was living in Worcestershire at the time, and because it was now in the early hours of the following day, he called the Worcestershire Crisis Team to arrange that. The nurse concerned was under the impression that by making† this phone call, and passing on Mr. Harpers details to the Crisis Team, he was referring Mr. Harpers case to them. He told the inquest that he was expecting mental health services in Worcestershire to arrange a further urgent assessment of Mr. Harper, and he therefore ensured that Mr. Harper was told to expect the Crisis Team to contact him to arrange a further assessment.(2)†† The Clinical Lead for the Crisis Team in Worcestershire gave evidence to the inquest that whilst the Crisis Team did receive a request from the nurse at Gloucester that night, they interpreted it only as a request for further assessment ( but not an urgent one ), and not as a request that Mr. Harper be referred to the Home Treatment Team.(3)†† In the event, an urgent assessment was not arranged, and Mr. Harpers case was only considered by the Home Treatment Team in Worcestershire when his temporary GP in Worcestershire, out of further concern for Mr. Harpers mental health, made a new and separate referral to them.(4)†† I have concluded that the events described above arose out of a lack of understanding between the two NHS Trusts concerned ( Herefordshire &amp;;;;;;;

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: A concern arose at the Inquest hearing in relation to the absence of liaison between the highly specialist services of the CADAT team and the stepdown services provided by NELFT. There was a lack of full information sharing around risk and joint risk assessment/risk management planning on discharge. Both mental health services were aware that Conrad was accessing aesthetic dermatology treatment. There was a concern that neither service adequately highlighted the risks of accessing such treatment to Conrad or attempted to share information with the skin clinic. The inquest heard that patients with BDD should be fully informed of the risks of seeking aesthetic dermatology treatment and wherever possible, clinics who are providing treatment should be made aware of the BDD diagnosis. The Inquest heard that there is a need for training to be provided to step-down service teams in relation to the diagnosis of BDD and the risks associated with it. The inquest heard that there is a lack of national resources for BDD. The highly specialised service at South London and Maudsley has a very long waiting list (several months). This is on a background of concerns of a likely increase in BDD. In light of this concern, I am also providing this report to the Royal College of Psychiatrists, to the Department for Health &amp;;;;;;;
Ref: 2023-0180;Martin Fleming;Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency;During the inquest I was referred by Mr Stevensons treating urologist to published literature relating to Ciprofloxacin and Quinolone antibiotics and a potential rare link to suicide behaviour in patients, although I found on the balance of probabilities that it remained unclear that he was suffering from this side effect, it remained possible for this to be the case.†The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:(brief summary of matters of concern)†¢† I heard evidence to suggest that the prescribing doctor did not reference this side effect at the time of issuing the prescription to Mr Stevenson, since it was not in accord with current advice.¢† I also heard evidence to suggest that prescribing doctors may not be fully aware of this rare side effect, and that patients suffering from depression may be more vulnerable to it.I am therefore concerned that this potential risk has not been given sufficient emphasis and I would ask you to consider the appropriateness of reviewing the current guidelines as to the dispensation of the drug to patients by clinicians and increasing the awareness of the side effect in order to monitor and mitigate the risks.;;;;;;;

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ††††† a. During the Inquest evidence was heard that Eifions GP had made a òveryurgent referral to the Single Point of Access and Allocation within BCUHB on 13 May 2022 indicating that on the background of attempts at ending his life, he was extremely concerned that Eifion was experiencing deterioration in his mental state. This document was contained within the hard copy set of notes held by the Psychiatric Liaison Team. When Eifion attended at the Emergency Department the following day, on 14 May 2022, the Emergency department staff were not aware of this òvery urgent referral as they only had access to the electronic notes and not the hard copy notes. Had they been aware it is likely to have further informed their decision making. It is concerning that the process of ensuring electronic notes to allow for fully informed decisions around treatment and care based on all available records, is not available to staff. It was not clear at Inquest whether the transition from paper-based notes to electronic notes was a Health Board initiative or a nationally followed initiative. Either way, any delay in ensuring all notes are available electronically is potentially harmful to patients.†b. During the evidence it was accepted that òa above was not a consideration for improvement as part of the Health Boards investigation and so was not an action within the Action Plan upon which it could make improvements or plan to make improvements. It is surprising that the Health Board did not consider this as an issue which required further consideration and improvements in its learning and improvement.†An investigation was commenced by the Health Board into Eifions death which appears to have been concluded in July 2022 but did not appear to be finalised and ready for sharing / disseminating until March 202 I have previously issued Prevention of Future Death Reports to the Health Board pertaining to the lack of timeliness of their investigations, specifically in relation to investigations from deaths in 2020 and 202 Whilst I have previously been advised of improvements into investigation processes in respect of more recent deaths the issue of timeliness remains. Eifion died in 2022 and yet the time it took for the investigation to be completed and shared, with actions undertaken has been too long. I am concerned that deaths will occur when the actions arising are not acted upon in a timely manner.;;;;;;;

[BRIEF SUMMARY OF MATTERS OF CONCERN](1) Brenda was discharged without any planned follow up. Her family were not involved in the discharge process despite assurances that they would be, her GP did not receive discharge notification from the Hadrian unit until 8 days after the event or from the Crisis team until 10 days after Brendas death. Referrals promised from Hadrian unit to Drug/Alcohol services and Persistent Physical Symptoms Service were not made.(2) Inadequate weight seems to have been given to Brendas alcohol problems and her assurances that all was, and would continue to be well were accepted at face value despite her recent history, her family find it hard to understand how she could be graded low risk on the day she died.(3) I refer you to the PFD report I issued referring to Charlotte Grace on 29/10/1 Assurances were given in response to that report which again focused on discharge without family/carer involvement which is surely paramount. I note actions mentioned in the incident report in this case but am still concerned that similar events may occur in future.;;;;;;;
Ref: 2023-0193;Mary Hassell;East London NHS Foundation Trust, Metropolitan Police Service, NHS England and Home Department;During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. When Ms Findlay ran off, the HCA escorting her was so panicked that she did not even think of following. Ms Findlay had run across a road and so chasing her at speed did present safety considerations. However, the ELFT policy, training, culture and expectation was such, that there the HCA did not at any point consider attempting to walk after her to keep her in sight. Clinical staff must be adequately prepared for such an eventuality.†That means more than simply a change in policy wording. By the time the HCA rang the duty senior nurse for advice Ms Findlay was out of sight, and so the HCA was instructed to return to the ward.†I heard evidence that an email is to be sent out shortly to explain that a new ELFT absent without leave policy will be in place by the end of June 202 The new policy will confirm that, if it is safe to do so an escort may follow a patient who has absconded, keeping them in line of sight whilst ringing the duty senior nurse for instructions.†However, there is no ELFT policy for what those instructions should be or even what they could include. No member of ELFT gave evidence of any organisational thought having gone into how then to progress such a situation, other than the ward calling the police to report a missing person. No member of ELFT giving evidence was able to set out what the staff member following should do.†This appears to be a significant omission.†Moreover, one of the MPS policy leads in this area gave evidence that in such a situation the police would not necessarily attend, even if called direct by a hospital staff member in the street following a patient about whom they are worried.†I spent some time examining the police regarding this point, and I was left with the impression that a clinician calling the police in what the clinician perceived to be an emergency situation might not be assisted by the police.†That concerned me.†I heard that Right Care, Right Person is an operational model developed by Humberside Police that changes the way the emergency services respond to calls involving concerns about mental health. I understand that it is in the process of being rolled out across the UK as part of ongoing work between police forces, health providers and government.†I heard that the MPS has already created a similar model under the resource and demand team. The protocol is called Affinity. It attempts to target preventable demand from the mental health trusts.†I was told that ELFT and the MPS work in partnership, so I asked the MPS what is meant to happen if an escort is following a patient who has run away and about whom the escort is worried.†I was told that this is primarily a health problem. It was pointed out that doctors, nurses and other hospital staff have the same powers as the police under section 18 of the Mental Health Act. Hospital employees have the legal authority to take a sectioned patient into custody and return them to hospital.†However, I heard nothing of an ELFT protocol that would advise staff on the ward to come out to assist an escort who already following a patient. I heard nothing of a trust contingency plan that would allow a ward to function without the doctors and nurses needed to undertake such a task. I heard nothing of any training given to doctors and nurses in how to restrain a patient in the middle of the street and to transport them back to the ward.†From the evidence I heard, the police / health trust partnership working allows each agency to regard such a situation as the others responsibility, whilst nobody is on the ground attempting to retrieve a seriously ill patient who is meant to be inside a locked ward for their own safety.†Whether this is a matter of policy or practice, the result is the same. If partner agency working is to be effective in caring for this extremely vulnerable cohort of patients, there needs to be crystal clear understanding by all those involved, from the highest policy maker to the most junior member of a team at the sharp end, of how to tackle these difficult situations and exactly who is meant to be doing what. Evidence was given that the police classify a person at high risk as: the risk is immediate and there are substantial grounds for believing immediate risk of self harm.†I was told by the MPS that, at the time of reporting to the MPS, trusts should volunteer their own grading of the patients risk. The police said that they will not necessarily following the trust grading, but they regard it as a significant factor and it should form part of the MPS thinking. ELFT witnesses told me that if the police did not ask for the trusts grading then the trust would not offer it.†I was told that, until April 2022 the grab pack prepared by ELFT for the MPS in such a situation was printed out and handed to police if &amp;;;;;;;

In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.†The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.†Evidence was given by staff members of the East London Foundation NHS Trust that:††The deceased was allowed to leave Gardener Ward (úthe unitù) which was part of a secure facility of the hospital, alone, when a clinical decision had been taken that they should not be allowed to leave the unit unaccompanied by staff, because they posed a serious risk of suicide.††The decision that the deceased should not be allowed unescorted leave was not communicated to all members of staff working in the unit such that the person who allowed the deceased to leave was unaware that the decision had been made.††The relevant information gathered during the Ward Round on the 28th October 2021, which included the fact that the deceased had attempted to take their own life, the night before, was not adequately communicated to all staff on the unit.††The úSign in/Sign outù book which was supposed to record the movements of service users in the unit was frequently not completed, particularly when service users went out for short periods.††There was no proper system for identifying whether a service user should be permitted to leave the unit.††The member of staff who allowed the deceased to leave the unit made a brief risk assessment of them before deciding whether they should be allowed to leave. That person did not consult any medical notes or records about the deceased when making that assessment. Had that member of staff consulted the deceaseds medical notes and records, the serious suicide risk which they posed would have been evident.†††Once the deceased was found to be missing from the unit, there was an unexplained delay in informing the police and ambulance service, a failure to inform either of the serious suicide risk which the deceased posed to themselves and a lack of appreciation of the urgency of the situation by staff generally.††The hospital policy which applied to missing patients was not properly adhered to by staff and there was confusion about who should be contacted and in what manner, once a patient was found to be missing.††No proper efforts were made to contact members of the deceaseds family once the deceased was found to be missing.††The unit was short-staffed and this affected the care provided to the deceased, the assessment of the deceased whilst in the unit and record keeping generally.†The summary of the evidence given, as set out above, sets out the matters of concern.;;;;;;;

Whilst ACCT 6 requires multidisciplinary attendance at review meetings, this case highlighted the need for specific attendance of an RMN or other mental health expert at any review, (Mr Robinson had repeatedly self harmed prior to committing suicide but had presented without concern at each review which had been carried out without any input from the mental health team). The prison in question now operates a local policy to ensure someone from the mental health team attends all ACCT reviews irrespective of other disciplines attending. This has enabled the prison to identify issues which may not be picked up by other professionals involved, to enable support to be put in place by way of separate care plans which has had a notable impact upon SASH in the prison.;;;;;;;
Ref: 2023-0163;Kristen Heaven;Swansea Bay University Health Board;During the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to a concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to make a report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013The first MATTERS OF CONCERN is as follows:I am concerned that in cases where an individual is receiving treatment from alcohol and drug addiction services and treatment from the primary community mental health team that neither team is able to access the other teams records electronically. The lack of integrated electronic records between treating team means that important information regarding patient safety is not easily accessible between treating teams. Treating teams are reliant on referral letters which are necessarily limited and not always sufficient to capture all the detailed information available to a referring team. This is particularly concerning where there is dual diagnosis  such as substance misuse and mental health  given these are often complex cases. This is particularly the case where complex cases have not been referred into secondary mental health services and so do not have access to a care-coordinator who can oversee and understand the views of the various professionals treating and assisting an individual.I am concerned that the lack of such an integrated electronic system of medical and treatment records inhibits the effective sharing of information regarding patient safety and so increases the risk that information of significance regarding a risk to life will be lost between agencies and not sufficiently understood between all those managing.;;;;;;;
Ref: 2023-0089;David Reid;Herefordshire & Worcestershire Health and Care NHS Trust;During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.†The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. †(1) During the 2Ω years in which Charlottes mental health care was provided by the Trust, she had total of 8 different care coordinators. Furthermore, in those 2Ω years there was a 5 month period when Charlotte had no appointed care coordinator at all. The care coordinator role is particularly important for a patient with such a complex case history as Charlotte.†I heard evidence that at the time of these events, the Trust had been experiencing an unprecedented level of instability, with many staff who might have been expected to fulfil care coordinator roles going off sick or even leaving the service. The witness who had conducted the Trusts own internal investigation into these events gave evidence that one of the major reasons for this instability was that staff were unable to cope with ever-increasing workloads. The Trusts Community Services manager for the Worcestershire Neighbourhood Teams appeared to corroborate this in his evidence, confirming that whilst national guidelines recommend a maximum of 30 patients per care coordinator, at the time of these events the Trusts care coordinators had around 100 patients each. Whilst he was able to provide some reassurance that a recent recruitment drive has reduced individual care coordinator caseloads to around 25 patients, he was unable to explain how individual caseloads had been able to reach the levels they did at the time of these events, and was unable to give accurate figures as to current levels of staff sickness/absence.†I am concerned that the Trust is unable to understand fully how the care coordinator system failed at the time of these events, and that it is therefore not in a position to guard against a repeat of these circumstances in the future.†(2) The erroneous decision to pause Charlottes referral to the Priory Hospital for specialist treatment for Body Dysmorphic Disorder was taken by a senior clinician acting on her own, despite a Multi-Disciplinary Team meeting having decided that the referral was appropriate. When asked about how the senior clinician could have overridden the MDT decision, the Trusts Community Services manager for the Worcestershire Neighbourhood Teams told the inquest that he could not say whether the senior clinician was not aware of the correct decision-making procedure, or whether she was, but chose instead to ignore it. When asked whether the same issue could arise in future, he told the inquest that he himself would be in a position to prevent the senior clinician making the wrong decision, but could not guarantee that he would be made aware of the issue so as to be able to do so.†I am concerned that the Trust has not properly established how the senior clinician was able to override the MDT decision, and does not have a sufficiently robust system in place to ensure that MDT decisions cannot be overridden in this way in future.;;;;;;;

Although a discharge plan was implemented in Ms. Findlays case, it would appear that steps were not taken to contact her emergency contact and/or next of kin, such as to facilitate Ms. Findlay being supported in the community upon discharge.

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. .†††† 5 NHS Trusts and 3 police forces in different geographic areas had contact with Patrick in the final month of his life and each thereby gained some information about the risk to him. However, that information was by reason of the agencies falling into different geographic areas. There was no single effective global focus for the information being acquired piecemeal about Patricks pattern of serious self-harming behaviour. The various agencies were significantly impeded in forming a single clear picture of Patricks pattern of behaviour (which was particularly necessary in circumstances where he was not engaging and therefore not assisting in providing a complete history himself).†††† GPs act as a repository for information about contact with other clinical agencies (such as attendances at accident and emergency departments) and therefore serve as a point of contact for information about past history. However, I heard evidence at inquest from accident and emergency consultants that it is either not possible to access information held by a GP practice out of GP surgery hours or where it is possible to do so that is only available if the GP is in the samegeographic area as the accident and emergency department. Several ofPatricks attendances at accident and emergency departments were out of GP surgery hours.†††† I was informed at inquest that one local authority (in whose area Patrick resided) had been made aware by police of the risk to Patrick following one of his self- harm incidents (in respect of a particularly important piece of information) and had relayed that information to a 6th NHS Trust (not one of the 5 from which I heard evidence at inquest) but Patrick did not reside in that Trust area. Those Trusts which did have direct contact with Patrick were never made aware of that piece of information nor had any means of accessing it.†††† I heard evidence that there is no national òrisk flagging system: for example, when a person attends an accident and emergency department having self- harmed, the fact of a previous self-harm attendance at a different accident and emergency department is not systematically flagged up.†††† In summary, there was no single effective global focus consolidating the information which was flowing into the various agencies about Patrick;;;;;;;
Ref: 2023-0094;Emma Brown;Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Foundation;CORONERS CONCERNS†During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.†The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. A multitude of factors contributed to Mr. Singhs death across the custodial and healthcare teams within HMP Birmingham. Many steps have been taken by all organisations with responsibility for Mr. Singhs safety and health during his time at HMP Birmingham to rectify failings that have been identified such as the consistent failure to use interpreters, poor communication and record keeping within and between teams, the absence of meaningful engagement with Mr. Singhs family, insufficient consideration of family concerns and failings in the use of the ACCT system. Much of the evidence at the inquest focused on the central issue of repeated missed opportunities to identify that Mr. Singh required admission to the prisons inpatient ward, ward 2, and assessment for section 48 transfer to a medium secure unit (which would have been likely to result in transfer to a medium secure unit). The consequences of the failure to transfer Mr. Singh to an inpatient setting were compounded by the fact that he was not taken onto the mental health teams caseload promptly and therefore did not have the benefit of an allocated CPN and the oversight and input of a mental health multi-disciplinary team. Many steps have been undertaken by Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Trust (who provide mental health services within the prison) to minimise the risk of such a situation occurring again. However, there are two features of the mental health care provided to Mr. Singh that create a risk to the lives of others that have not yet been rectified:i.††the fact that the mental health team multi-disciplinary team (MDT) does not include a psychiatrist;;;;;;;

The Inquest heard evidence from the Head of Service for Safeguarding and Learning for Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council. She highlighted a long-standing gap in provision, which was described as extending across most if not all local authorities, for vulnerable adults who have complex needs, but who do not fall into the existing framework of social services, Care Act provision or formal mental health supervision. The effect of that gap is that there is no identifiable individual who is a single point of contact in such cases equivalent to a social worker or care coordinator. The result is that many vulnerable adults with complex needs have no such arrangements in place for contact, collating and sharing of information and deployment of services and assistance, support or safeguarding. Where such arrangements are in place, they are necessarily ad hoc in nature in differing frameworks, levels and standards, and can devolve by default to an individual who, whilst well-motivated, may lack the skills and training to properly perform the function, particularly when the vulnerable adult may be in crisis.;;;;;;;

This was the reason for his dismissal from his former occupation as a police officer in the MPS (Metropolitan Police Service).†If Mr Roberts DBS certificate had correctly recorded his conviction, he would not have been employed at Proof House where he had access to firearms.†It is unclear to me whether the inaccuracy of the DBS certificate was caused by an error made by the DBS or by the MPS.;;;;;;;

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTER OF CONCERN is as follows:The Commission for Human Medicine (CHM) established an lsotretinoin Expert Working Group (IEWG) in response to concerns about psychiatric events. The IEWG considered oral and written evidence over 2020 and 202 The findings and recommendations of the IEWG were presented in a report to the CHM at the end of 2021 and include a recommendation which relates to prescribing for patients under the age of 1 † It is now over a year since the IEWG report was completed and the recommendations have still not been implemented. In that time there have been 45 adverse lsotretinion events reported to the Medicines Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) comprising of 81 psychiatric adverse events, one of which was an attempted suicide. The Court heard that a second working group is required to consider how to implement the IEWG recommendations and that this group has yet to meet.;;;;;;;

(1)†† Essex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust staff immediate emergency response was not followed:a.†††† pinpoint alarms were not activated immediately on finding Sharon Langley unresponsiveb.†††† there was a delay calling the ambulance and basic key information about the type of the emergency was not relayed:i.† by qualified nurses who made the 999 calls, orii. to paramedics on attendancec.†††† there was a delay informing the site co-ordinator of the emergency even though she was based on the ward and there was a lack of co- ordination of the emergency resulting in the ambulance being called a second time by the site co-ordinatord.†††† staff trained in basic life support did not assist the two nurses who were attempting to resuscitate Sharon LangleyThere was a difference in the safety measures fitted to the bathroom door on the adjoining Stort Ward that had a self-closure mechanism at the time of Sharons death. This mechanism has now been fitted to Chelmer Ward. There is a concern that safety information is not shared across the Trust and known risks are not mitigated appropriately.(3) The Trust was on notice of issues on Chelmer ward with doors to high- risk areas not closing that included the Staff Room and Patient Storeroom.a.†††† At the time of Sharons death, the mitigation on the ward was for staff to push doors to see if they were locked, this was action even though evidence was heard that these doors had keylocks and staff had keys that could have been used.b.†††† The Patient Storeroom contains items removed from patients as they pose a significant self-harm risk and/or suicide.c.†††† Staff Room that contains items that pose a risk to patientsSelf-closure mechanisms have not been fitted to these doors in a high- risk environment of a secure psychiatric ward even though the risk is known. Evidence was heard from patient safety that it is sufficient to have maintenance manually adjust doors if there are closure issues.(4)†† Chelmer Ward staff did not always report door closure issues either on the ward to the Nurse in Charge or to maintenance. Following the death of Sharon Langley there has been no training on how to report door closure issues reported.(5)†† Evidence was heard that the bath plug was required to be kept in the ward office when not in use as the bathroom was a high-risk area. There was no evidence that staff had to obtain this from the office on the day Sharon Langley died. There still appears to be confusion around the requirement.(6)†† There is concern about the reliability of the Trust investigation and how the Trust learns lessons.

Ref: 2023-0068;Catherine Wood;NHS Kent and Medway Clinical Commissioning Group;During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. †During the course of the inquest reference was made to the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance úAutistic Spectrum disorder in under 19s: support and management.ù Published on 28 August 2013 and in particular paragraph 4 which states that ú<em>Local autism teams should ensure that every child or young person diagnosed with autism has a case manager or key worker to manage and coordinate treatment, care, support and transition to adult care in line with the NICE guideline on autism in children and young people (covering identification and diagnosis). Stefan did not have a case manager or key worker. I am unable to say if the lack of a case manager or key worker caused or contributed more than minimally to Stefans death but had one been available they may have been able to assist Stefan and his family to navigate the services available which in turn may have led to intervention which may have made a difference. I am prohibited from returning a conclusion which comments on issues where there is no clear causal link with the death however the Coroners andJustice Act 2009 creates a duty on Coroners to report an issue which gives rise to a concern which may lead to future deaths. I asked for further evidence on the provision of case managers/key workers in accordance with the NICE guidance after the inquest from North East London Foundation Trust and from Kent and Medway Integrated Care Board. It is clear from the evidence provided that such a service is only provided to those under 19 year olds who have both a learning disability and/or a diagnosis of autism and are at risk of admission to a mental health hospital or where there is a significant sudden deterioration in the community and the multi disciplinary team has not been responsive. The lowest level of service outlined in reply to the court indicated that referrals could be made to a key worker to sign post families not that they would have a key worker allocated to them. This sets the bar at a level which means a large number of young people with a learning disability and/or autism would not have a key worker nor would they be expected to have one.†In the evidence provided it was outlined thatúKeyworkers will make sure that these children, young people and families get the right support at the right time. They will make sure that local systems are responsive to fully meeting the young peoples needs in a joined-up way and that whenever it is possible to provide care and treatment in the community with the right support this becomes the norm.ùIf every autistic child or young person had a key worker this would enable them or their family the opportunity to liaise with their key worker rather than having to try to navigate services themselves. This, in turn, may prevent others from encountering the issues faced by Stefans family and ultimately prevent future deaths.;;;;;;;

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:Evidence was heard from police officers from both the Metropolitan Police and Suffolk Constabulary.The officers provided evidence of the details they respectively held regarding the missing person investigation surrounding Anthonys disappearance from London and subsequent death.It was clear that crucial information (that Anthony had a rope in his possession, and a collapsible bicycle providing a secondary form of transport) was not passed between the Metropolitan Police and Suffolk Constabulary.†It was heard that there was no set format, or prescribed information requirements to be shared by officers reporting missing persons between one force and another. Investigating officers in the Metropolitan police spoke to the Suffolk Constabulary control room, whose staff logged what they were told onto the CAD record. This information was then relayed to the officers on the ground.†Witnesses in this case stated that there is no standardised information sharing requirement or protocol for cross border missing persons investigations (including missing persons with suicidal ideation).†I am concerned that, as there is no standardised information sharing requirements or protocols in such cases, in the future a force receiving details of a suicidal missing person may also not be informed that an individual has taken a means of suicide with them. In addition, other important information that may assist in the search for that person may also not be passed.;;;;;;;

Ref: 2023-0034;Fiona Butler;Inmind Healthcare Group;During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.†The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) Emergency Response†I heard during the course of the inquest that when an alarm sounded staff would attend the location of the alarm, assess the situation and then go and collect what equipment may be necessary to deal with the emergency.†At the time of Samanthas death there was only 1 emergency bag for the entire hospital (which had 2 wards and separate self-contained flats on the site). This has now been rectified and there is an emergency bag for every ward.†Staff partake in a drill and evidence provided to me for the purposes of Regulation 28 showed that response times of staff remain at 2 minutes to a patients side.†However, I was told that the emergency response still has staff attend a patient, assess and then go and collect the emergency bag, rather than taking it immediately to the patients side.†I was provided with evidence for the purposes of Regulation 28 by Inmind Healthcare Group which showed, for example, that in December of 2022 there were 64 incidents, 45 of which were self-harm, 2 of which were clinical incidents. 16 resulted in actual harm and a large number of those incidents concerned patients ligating.†To continue with an emergency response which delays the provision of life saving equipment to the patients side is unsafe and in my opinion could lead to future deaths.†The delay in providing CPR to Samantha on balance had no causative effect on her death, but it could for another patient.† Observation Policy†At the time of Samanthas death observations were conducted and recorded in a predictable and prescriptive way by healthcare staff. The quality of observations recorded at the time of Samanthas death were such that they did not accord with the expectation of the policy and merely recorded where the patient was and what they were doing.†Effective observations were acknowledged as being a vital tool to assess and manage the risk of a patient.†Inmind Healthcare Groups new observation Policy states:†òObservations are a therapeutic intervention aimed at reducing factors which contribute to increased risk and promoting recovery. The use of enhanced observation levels should never be regarded as routine practice¶¶.Observation practice must focus on engaging the person therapeutically and enabling them to address their difficulties constructively. Our interactions must seek to create rapport which allows those in our care to feel valued and safe to share their experiences with us.†Since Samanthas death changes have been made by Inmind Healthcare Group to their policy and practice, in that observations are now recorded at the precise time they are conducted and are infrequent in their predictability (eg: hourly observation should be conducted once hourly rather than on the hour every hour).†Evidence of recent observation records demonstrated that this was now practice.†However, there was a disconnect between the new policy and the pre-printed forms being used to record observations;;;;;;;
Ref: 2022-0417;Crispin Oliver;HM Prison and Probation Service;During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.†The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:Between his arrival in SACU at 137 on 10 July 2020 and his being discovered self suspended with a ligature at 145 on 11 July 2020 there, Michael was subject to a 3 man unlock.On the morning of 11 July, a Saturday, there were 3 officers on duty on SACU. This did permit his cell to be unlocked for a meal to be delivered and for a cursory one and a half minute conversation with a nurse that fell short, on her evidence, of an actual medical examination.On the afternoon of 11 July there were only one or (briefly) two officers on SACU duty per the staff duty log, albeit, as CCTV footage shows, more officers did attend intermittently for specific tasks. The SACU staff duty log shows only one officer on duty for the whole afternoon to 100. In any event medical assessments of Michael were not undertaken at any stage while he was on SACU, the reason being given that he was on three man unlock. It appears that there were never sufficient staff available for a dedicated medical assessment to be undertaken. This notwithstanding that evidence from prison officers and a nurse was that during the course of the afternoon Michale`s presentation had becomeú</em>angrier<em>ùandú</em>bizarre<em>ù</em>. In fact, it is now known, he had been ingesting toxic amounts, an unlicensed drug, he had secreted into the prison (his being detected at reception as plugged led him to SACU).†††††††† is a highly potent††††††††† which effects judgement and lowers inhibitions. The jury subsequently concluded that the absence of medical, and mental health, assessments, and the use of the†††††††††††††††††††††††††† (which was never diagnosed), contributed to the Michael`s death.From 100, when patrol state commenced, there was clearly only one officer on duty and present. When she discovered Michael self suspended that officer made a perfectly defensible dynamic assessment, electing not to enter the cell unsupported. She made ready to enter for when back up arrived. In the event, partly because there was another discipline incident unfolding on a different wing, this took 2-3 minutes. There were only 16 prison officers available while on patrol state across the entire prison, and they were already at full stretch, and probably beyond it (the Tactical Resources Unit from Doncaster were en route).The evidence was that without knowing precisely when Michael self-suspended any such delay could not be held, on a balance of probabilities, to have entered the chain of causation death. However, the fact remains that there was a delay consequent to Michael being on a three man unlock but there being only a single officer available on SACU while in patrol state. It is reasonable to conjecture that this could have made the difference between life and death in this case, and the repetition of these circumstances could well do so in future.In your response dated 15 November 2021 to the Regulation 28 report of HM Assistant Coroner James Thompson of 21 September 2021 following the Inquest into the death of Charlie Brian Todd at HMP Durham, you wrote, amongst other things:†<em>ú</em>There is clear management oversight of the SACU<em>ù</em>.†This is not what the evidence in the instance case showed. Rather, what it made clear was that:†1) the SACU staff log plus CCTV further demonstrated that HMAC Thompson`s point to you thatú</em>officers, including officers not posted to SACU, but covering for a shift, were required to allocate various task between themselves on an ad-hoc basis<em>ùwas an ongoing problem, and this appears to be still ongoing;;;;;;;

That seems to have been a likely trigger for Sean to take his own life.The next day he was on leave and went to the Luton Airport Police base where the Southern Armoury was located. He was the Armed Response base sergeant.Sean entered the equipment room, where the manual override keys to the armoury were located in a locked box secured by a PIN. Officer [REDACTED] who were present in the equipment room said Sean appeared startled to find them there. He remained cheerful and engaged in cheeky banter†[REDACTED] was of the view that Sean entered so that he could access the armoury key.Sean, discovering his access to the override key was blocked asked one of the officers to second him into the armoury. By chance, it was†[REDACTED] who agreed and went with Sean to the armoury. She had been given single access by error systems failure some time previously. Sean applied his armoury and entered his PIN. It failed. [REDACTED] and used her card and PIN. Because she was allowed  incorrectly  single access, the door opened and she let Sean in where he retrieved a handgun and ammunition. Had [REDACTED] any other officer at base known that Seans access had been restricted she would not, I amcertain, have allowed him entry.There was a serious failure by senior management to effectively and safely manage the South Base Armoury. All the base officers who gave evidence before me told me the armoury system, which they referred to as Chronicle, repeatedly and randomly failed. These multiple failures were, according to [REDACTED] not communicated effectively to her. She agreed that she did not herself make any further detailed enquiry instead relying on her Operational Inspector to manage the issue and/or to feed back as appropriate.The computerised system controlling the access to the armoury at South Base included a number of different parts including the server, the software, the Chronicle system itself, the card readers etc. The system as a whole repeatedly failed. There was no effective ongoing monitoring of the system. CI Rowley Smith agreed that thesystem did not work properly and the monitoring system did not work properly. As part of a fail safe to ensure that officers who needed weapons could obtain them if the computerised system failed, an armoury override key was kept in a locked box, secured by a PIN, in the equipment room. All officers giving evidence before me agreed that the PIN number was common knowledge.The fact that the PIN number was common knowledge meant potentially that any one of the officers working at the base had unfettered access to the armoury [REDACTED]. The fact that the access was not abused by the officers was due wholly to their trustworthiness and professionalism. On this occasion, Sean sought access to the armoury via the key but was thwarted by both PC being present in the equipment room. Unfettered access to the armoury meant that rogue officers (of whom luckily there were none) could potentially have had access to weapons for the purposes of criminality, suicide (as in Seans case) or homicide.Overall, I find the lax approach to safety and security in the South Base armoury by senior management, who were responsible, to be extraordinary.†[REDACTED] agreed that the armoury was an unsafe environment.In the interval between Seans death and the Inquest some 18 months later, I was not reassured that effective action had been taken to secure the armoury. Immediately post Inquest some reassurance was provided but gaps remained.;;;;;;;

In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.†††††† The ELFT serious incident (SI) review report identified that, although Mr Largin was discharged to the Woodberry Wetlands neighbourhood rehabilitation team from the crisis (i.e. home treatment) team on 25 January 2022, the neighbourhood team did not allocate him to a team member until 3 February.†††††† The report also identified that, despite receiving an email from the Homerton University Hospital community rehabilitation team on 2 February, saying that Mr Largin had been seen on 1 February and was still very depressed, the crisis team failed to reassess him or to re-open his case to the crisis team, but instead referred the community team to the neighbourhood team.†††††† However, the SI report did not identify that the crisis team member who made the decision on 2 February simply to advise that Mr Largin should be dealt with by the neighbourhood team failed to record any reasons for her decision.†††††† The SI reviewer giving evidence in court said that the SI reviewing team had not even spoken to that crisis team member as part of their investigation, let alone fed back to her.      He said they did not at the time realise that she still worked for ELFT, though he accepted that it would have been an extremely straight forward matter to find out. The crisis team members manager gave evidence that she thought the relevant decision maker had left the team before Mr Largins death, so between 3 and 6 February 202 When I invited that manager to make a call while the inquest was ongoing to check, she later told me that the team member had not left the crisis team until 29 April 202††† It is believed, I was told, that there was a hot de-brief after Mr Largins death. However, no notes were made of that and no entry was made on Mr Largins medical record.†††††Thus, nobody from ELFT found out what the decision makers thinking had been, or what misconceptions she might have had that other staff members might share. The former crisis team member who made the decision still works for ELFT. As far as I could ascertain, her decision making concerning Mr Largin has never been discussed with her by ELFT managers.†††††The SI review also did not identify that members of the crisis team and the neighbourhood team did not share an understanding of how quickly the neighbourhood team aims to make contact with patients, to assist in their decision making about the correct pathway for a patient. In fact, a member of the neighbourhood team itself gave evidence about the response times that, I was told later, was not correct.††††† Finally, the operations lead for the neighbourhood team had great difficulty in giving me clear evidence about whether his team would or could refer a patient back to the crisis team if they felt the circumstances warranted.
